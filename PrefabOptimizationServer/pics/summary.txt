Conclusion:
1. The parameter won't influence the results more than 0.5%.
2. 1 stop per wall is more sensitive to the GA parameter in compare with 2 stop per wall.
3. The initial point is also palys an important role for the optimization.

To save the computational power:
The idea parameter is: 
1. mutation rate: 5%.
2. generation: 10
3. iteration for each situation: 3-5.
