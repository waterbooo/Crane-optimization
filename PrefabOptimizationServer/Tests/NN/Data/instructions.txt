Prepare it
Plan it
To determine the pattern (so a single tile will lie at the center of the room) determine the center of your room by finding the center of each wall. 
Measure the length of each wall and divide the length by two. 
Mark this midpoint with a pencil.
Measure the width of the tile and divide it by two. 
Place the center of the tile at the wall’s center mark. 
Then mark the wall at each end of the tile. 
Repeat this process on the three remaining walls and then snap chalk lines from the marks to those on the parallel wall across the room. 
Place the first carpet square in center of the cross hair and work tiles out from that center point. 
If the carpet squares have an adhesive backing, do not remove the cover from the backing yet. 
Use multiple colored squares to create any pattern you like. 
Pull up and change the pattern at any time. 
Once the pattern is determined, remove backing from the squares and smooth into place.
Turn the carpet square upside down and set it flush with the wall and mark at both ends where the carpet square overlaps the next to the last rows of full carpet squares. 
Use a carpenter’s square or straight edge and a utility knife to make a straight clean cut on the backside of the carpet square. 
Install the partial square with the cut edge against the baseboard (molding will cover it if it is not exactly even).
Leave tiles in the room they are to be laid in for at least 24 hours, to acclimatise to conditions before you lay them.
At your chosen starting point (see overpage) just draw a pencil line across the floor surface with a straight edge like a length of batten.
Remove the backing from the first tile. Make sure you don't get any dust or grit on the adhesive surface, or the tile might not sit well or stick securely.
Place the tile in position at the starting point and smooth it flat. Be exact with positioning as the adhesive will go off quickly.
Position the second tile, tightly against the first – a rolling pin is a good tool to use for flattening down tiles. 
Keep adding tiles and rows across the floor.
For the space around the edge, measure the gap and mark on a tile for cutting. 
Use a straight edge – an aluminium rule is ideal – and a retractable knife to cut tiles on a wood surface.
Remove the backing from the cut tile and stick it in place.
Continue filling gaps. 
Use a profile gauge to mark out the contours around the base of an awkward shape, such as by the architrave.
Mark off the profile of the cut required on a tile with a pencil. 
Cut the profile using a retractable knife and stick the tile in place.
At doorways, measure and cut thresholds to fit and cover the join. 
Unroll and stick a length of double-sided tape adjacent to the starting line. 
Tape every third row and the flooring will be securely held in place.
Take off the adhesive tape backing on the double-sided tape and start positioning the first row of tiles.
Butt tiles tightly up against each other.
Check directional arrows on the back of the tiles before laying.
Build up rows, working across the floor. 
Keep checking that edges are firmly butted up against each other, laying the double-sided tape every third row.
Around the edge, measure and cut edge tiles accurately for a neat finish. 
Use a retractable knife and a straight edge. 
Stick in place until all gaps are filled.
Remember to add 10% for cutting wastage.
Fix the plywood or hardboard to wooden floors using ring-shank nails or screws at 10cm intervals.
Leave the tiles in the room they are to be laid for at least 24 hours to acclimatise to the environment.
Firstly, find your starting point. 
Once you have found the centre of the room, you need to lay your tiles from that point towards the wall in each direction.
Dry lay your tiles on the floor to finalise the pattern and position before sticking them down.
Measure twice and cut once for the edge tiles to ensure a neat finish. 
Use a craft knife and a straight edge to cut carpet tiles.
Check that the tiles are placed so that the pattern or nap of the carpet is laid in the same direction.
From your starting point, stick a length of double-sided tape next to this line.
Take off the backing tape on the double-sided tape and position the first row of tiles. 
Remember to butt the tiles closely together.
Tape every third row to hold the flooring securely in place.
Please take a moment to read through our DIY safety tips, before you get started on any of our 'how to' guides.
Start by multiplying the width of your room by the length to find the main area.
Then add or subtract the area of any bay windows, alcoves, chimney breasts or door thresholds.
Divide the area of the room by the area of a single tile, rounding up to the nearest whole number. 
Add 5% to 10% and this is the number of tiles you should buy.
Check your tiles have the same batch number so they match. 
And, of course, make sure they're the right type of tile for the area you're covering.
On old floors, remove all previous floor coverings and any adhesives used to stick them down.
If you're putting tiles on floorboards, overlay the boards with hardboard, smooth side up. 
Prime all porous surfaces - including concrete, sand and cement screed, plywood, hardboard and chipboard - with a diluted solution of PVA. 
Follow manufacturer's instructions.
If your tiles aren't self-adhesive, buy the tile manufacturer's recommended adhesive.
You can stick carpet tiles down with a 'low tack' adhesive or double-sided tape so they can be lifted and replaced easily.
To do this, mark a chalk line down the centre of the room (fig. 2). 
Then, starting in the centre of the doorway, mark a second line at a 90-degree angle to the first line (fig.3).
'Loose lay' tiles along these lines to see how the borders appear (fig.4). 
If you end up with awkward narrow strips of tiles at the edge of the room, simply adjust the chalk lines to avoid this.
Don't cover access to plumbing and electrical services.
'Ping' a chalk line (a tight string covered in chalk dust) to mark a line down the centre of the room.
Starting in the centre of the doorway, mark a second line at 90 degrees to the first.
Loose lay a first line of tiles along the chalk lines.
Start laying tiles in rows along your chalk line. 
Lay all the centre tiles first. Leave out the last full rows and the row of border tiles (fig.5).
Don't put adhesive on the last full rows or borders until you've cut the border tiles and are ready to lay them.
Place each tile carefully - butting it firmly and squarely up to its neighbours. 
Don't slide the tiles as this can force adhesive into the joints and make a bad fit. 
Remove all excess adhesive with a damp rag before it goes hard (obviously you wouldn't do this for self-adhesive or carpet tiles).
Lay the centre tiles first.
Use a hammer and a softwood block to level out the height of vinyl tiles.
To cut your border tiles, loose lay a whole tile (tile 'A' in fig. 7). 
Place another tile over it with its edge butting up to the wall.
Score the lower tile with a craft knife ('A' in fig. 7). 
Otherwise use a safe blade to finish the cut. 
Always use a safe blade on carpet tiles.
Use the same method to cut the corners as shown in fig. 8.
To cut a border tile start by 'loose laying' a whole tile ('A')
To cut corner tiles simply use the method for cutting border tiles.
With vinyl tiles, don't shape a tile to go round the architrave. 
But with carpet tiles, make a cardboard template and cut the shape out of the tile.
With a hand saw and chisel, remove a section of architrave to the same depth as your tile and slot the tile underneath it (fig. 9).
To do this, make a cutter out of a scrap of pipe by sharpening the inside edge of one end with a file.
Mark the pipe's position on your border tile, then line up the cutter and hit it with a hammer (fig. 10).
Then make a single straight cut from the hole to the edge of the tile and fit it around the pipe.
To fit your tiles under an architrave, saw away a section at the bottom to the same depth as a tile.
To make a hole for a pipe, mark the pipe's position on your border tile, line up the cutter and hit it with a hammer.
Where your tiles finish in a doorway use a metal threshold strip to give a neat water-resistant edge. 
Measure the width of your door opening and cut the metal strips with a junior hacksaw. 
Then smooth the ends with a fine file. Screw the threshold strip into the floor.
To fix threshold strips into a solid floor, mark the screw holes. 
Use a masonry drill to bore holes to fit a wall plug and screw the strips to the floor
To get the best overall look for your carpet tiles, lay them at right angles to each other. 
If you prefer a 'broadloom' carpet appearance, lay all your tiles pointing in the same direction.
When buying carpet tiles, get a few spares to replace any tiles that get damaged or worn.
Lay each tile at right angles to each other to get the best overall effect.
Follow the five simple steps below to achieve a professional looking finish.

Make sure you have acclimatised the carpet tiles for at least 24 hours prior to fitting. 
To do this just lift the tiles from the boxes and stack in piles around the room to circulate the air between. 
When doing so take care not to damage any corners. 
You can either sweep the floor or use a vacuum cleaner to lift any loose dirt or dust. 
Any existing floor coverings like carpet or underlay must be totally removed prior to fitting. 
All damp floors need to be sealed first with an appropriate sealer. 
Repair uneven floors or damage with a self levelling screed.
Measure the width and length of the floor to determine the centre of the room. 
Mark with a chalk line or pencil where the lines cross. 
Next check the number of full tiles both ways and try to leave at least half a tile to cut round the edge.
If need be adjust the centre point and re-mark. 
When laying the tiles using carpet tile tackifier adhesive make sure you have carefully read the instructions on the rear of the tub before use. 
From your centre line marks work your way out from the middle of the room with whole tiles to build up the floor. 
Make sure to butt each one up tight to the other without trapping pile between the joints. 
If you loose lay the tiles we recommend using double sided tape to stop the tiles from moving during fitting. 
Once all the whole tiles have been laid do the cuts around the perimeter. 
Either use a profile gauge, cardboard template (if cutting round a pedestal basin in a bathroom) or simply measure and mark on the rear of the tile. 
Remember always cut from the back of the tile and mind your fingers!
To cut the tiles simply score two or three times from the back with a sharp knife and snap like plasterboard. 
Then draw the knife along the cut line for a clean edge on the pile. 
When all the cuts have been completed vacuum the floor to remove any debris left behind from fitting. 
Always fix the middle rows and around the perimeter edge by using double sided carpet tape. 
During fitting periodically check the tiles are tight and aligned as a poorly fitted floor can move.
For further information or advice please contact us on 01485 528993.
1. Always use a new, sharp blade
2. Allow tackifier adhesive to fully dry
3. Always cut from the back of the tile 
If fitting carpet tiles on an area which has underfloor heating or access flooring, please contact us for full fitting instructions.
Ensure the floor is level as carpet tiles are designed to lay flat naturally. 
Each tile has an arrow on the back indicating the direction of the pile - to achieve a broadloom (carpet) effect make sure the arrows on the rear of tiles all point the same direction. 
To achieve a chequerboard (chessboard) effect using all one colour then lay the tiles with the arrows on the back at right angles to each other (see above diagram).
1. Measure the distance between the opposite walls to obtain the centre and draw a line. 
Repeat this with the other walls
2. Check to ensure that you are not left with a very small strip against the wall or in a doorway. 
If necessary adjust the starting point slightly off centre
3. Lay double sided tape or Tackifier and allow to fully dry
4. Start laying the tiles at the centre as indicated in the diagram and work outwards.
Lay all tiles which need no cutting before starting on those which need to be cut
5. Ensure that each tile butts up to its neighbour as tightly as possible.
However, do not cause 'peaks' by joining the tiles too tightly
6. Ensure that no pile trapped between the tiles
7. Finally cut edge tiles to fit neatly to walls and skirting

Plan your pattern and order the carpet
Draw a layout
Draw the room to scale on graph paper to experiment with different designs. 
Mark your baseline rows on the sketch.
Then sketch the room to scale and use colored pencils or markers to draw in the squares (Photo 1).
Arrange your layout to avoid leaving narrow strips along the walls. 
If possible, allow at least 4-in.-wide sections of carpet along each wall. 
Determine the room's square footage by multiplying the length by the width (round up measurements to the nearest foot). 
For irregular-shaped rooms, divide the floor into individual sections, calculate the square footage of each, then add them together. 
Order the carpet, adding an extra 10 percent for waste.
Assess your existing floor
Conduct a moisture test (kits available at home centers) before carpeting a concrete floor. 
Let new concrete cure for at least 90 days first. 
Screw down any loose areas of floor and replace any water-damaged sections. 
Layout lines
Clean the floor, then snap chalk lines parallel to the walls to create perpendicular baselines.
Lay carpet squares along both baselines, starting at the center. 
Remove the protective film, butt the squares tightly and adhere them to the floor.
Cut tight to walls
Place the last carpet square face down against the wall and under the previous square. 
Mark it, cut it to size with a carpet knife and install it.
Make cuts with a carpet knife, which cuts carpet more accurately than a standard utility knife
Prepare the floor by sweeping or vacuuming up all dust and grit. 
Then, using your sketch as a guide, pick the spot for the base rows (Photo 2). 
Keep them as close to the center of the room as possible, since they guide the rest of the installation.
Measure and snap your perpendicular baselines for those rows (Photo 2). 
Lay carpet squares (without adhesive) along both baselines to test the layout. 
If you end up with gaps less than 4 in. next to walls, shift the layout and snap new baselines.
To install the squares, start where the baselines intersect and work outward (Photo 3). 
Keep the directional arrows (Photo 4) on the back of the squares pointing in the same direction.
Peel the film off the adhesive strips and butt each square tightly against the preceding one. 
Don't adhere the last full square until you cut the final square to size (Photo 4). 
After you cut the square, add two adhesive strips so there's one in all four corners. 
Then adhere the final pieces.
Use a sharp blade and make several shallow passes. 
Cut the squares on a smooth surface, like hardboard. 
Avoid cutting on a plywood subfloor since the wood grain can pull the blade off line.
Fill in the quadrants
Install carpet squares in each quadrant, starting at the center and moving outward. 
Adhere only the squares along the baselines and walls.
With the base rows in place, start back at the center and fill in the quadrants using a “step” pattern (Photo 5). 
Simply press each square snugly against adjacent squares, keeping carpet strands out of the joints. 
If the adhesive residue remains, remove it with rubbing alcohol.
Mark cuts in place
Place a carpet square right side up against an archway wall, aligning it with installed squares. 
Mark the wall location on the edges of the carpet.
Mark both sides of the cut
Cut on the back
Flip the square over and use a marker and a carpenter's square to draw the wall shape from the marks you just made. 
Cut out the opening.
Cut against the edge of the square for a straight cut.
Install the square against the archway wall. 
Fine-tune the cut, if necessary, so the square fits snug.
Use templates for tough cuts
Make a full-size template for doorjambs with complicated trim and doorstops. 
Transfer the outline onto a carpet square, then cut the square.
Cut filler pieces from scrap to fill any gaps between the walls and squares. 
Wedge the pieces into place, then smooth them with your hand.
Butt the carpet against the flooring in adjacent rooms, or overlap the edge of the adjoining floor.
Start by setting a square against the face of the archway wall, overlapping and aligned with the previously installed square (Photo 6). 
Mark the carpet on each side of the wall, then place the same square against the side of the wall and mark it.
Using the marks, outline your cut with your carpenter's square as a guide (Photo 7). 
To fit carpet around odd-shaped obstacles, such as doorjambs with angular trim, first make a paper template.
You'll need to make several measurements, transfer them to paper, then cut out the opening. 
Once the template fits, trace the outline onto the back of a carpet square and cut it (Photo 9).
Don't worry if the cut isn't perfect and you end up with a gap—carpet squares are very forgiving! 
Just cut a small sliver of carpet from a scrap piece and tuck it snugly into the gap (Photo 10).
After all of the squares are installed, vacuum the floor. 
If the spill doesn't wipe up, remove the square and rinse it with water in the sink. 
Let it dry and replace it in the floor. 
For squares with permanent stains, just replace the old square with a new one.
Have the necessary tools for this DIY project lined up before you start — you’ll save time and frustration.
Avoid last-minute shopping trips by having all your materials ready ahead of time. 
1. Choose a pattern
Double check your product specifications to make sure your desired layout works with your tiles. 
You can pre-lay a few carpet tiles in different arrangements to get an idea of how they’ll look in your space.
2. Clear the space
Of course, you need to clear the space you’ll be working on next before you proceed.
3. Clean and inspect the existing floor
When prepping your installation site, make sure the that surface is: clean, dry, level
If you’re replacing existing carpet, rip up the old stuff and remove all tack strips. 
Repair damaged areas, vacuum or sweep your floors, then clean them.
4. Gather tools
Additionally, consider asking another person to help you lay chalk lines. 
Read all the instructions that come with your carpet tiles about which adhesive you should use.
5. Determine the center of your room
You should install your tiles from the center of the room outward, but to do that accurately, you must determine where this point is. 
Find and mark the center of each wall in the room. 
Then, snap chalk lines between opposing walls using the midpoints as your guide.
Do this in both directions and make sure your chalk lines are square with one another. 
Install your tiles from the center of the room.
6. Lay the tiles
Next, place your first tile right in the center of the plus mark and work out from there, eventually forming the carpet row by row. 
Lay the pieces before you adhere them to the floor so you can make adjustments as needed. 
For instance, you may have to cut tiles to fit around corners or in small areas.
Use your utility knife to slice the tile from the back – do not cut on the carpet side. 
Additionally, make sure the cut piece is at least half the size of the original square. 
Check to ensure you’ve continued the pattern you started with, and rotate any pieces that don’t follow your desired pattern.
7. Adhere the tiles
All you have to do is peel the protective coating to reveal the sticky part. 
Press the tile into the floor.
Swipe the glue on the floor and spread an even coating over the surface where your carpet tile will go.
Having a level surface is important, so take care when adding adhesive.
Make sure you have acclimatised the carpet tiles for at least 24 hours prior to fitting. 
To do this just lift the tiles from the boxes and stack in piles around the room to circulate the air between. 
When doing so take care not to damage any corners. 
You can either sweep the floor or use a vacuum cleaner to lift any loose dirt or dust. 
Any existing floor coverings like carpet or underlay must be totally removed prior to fitting. 
Repair uneven floors or damage with a self levelling screed.
Measure the width and length of the floor to determine the centre of the room.
Mark with a chalk line or pencil where the lines cross. 
Next check the number of full tiles both ways and try to leave at least half a tile to cut round the edge.
If need be adjust the centre point and re-mark. 
When laying the tiles using carpet tile tackifier adhesive make sure you have carefully read the instructions on the rear of the tub before use. 
From your centre line marks work your way out from the middle of the room with whole tiles to build up the floor. 
Make sure to butt each one up tight to the other without trapping pile between the joints. 
Once all the whole tiles have been laid do the cuts around the perimeter. 
Either use a profile gauge, cardboard template (if cutting round a pedestal basin in a bathroom) or simply measure and mark on the rear of the tile.
Remember always cut from the back of the tile and mind your fingers!
To cut the tiles simply score two or three times from the back with a sharp knife and snap like plasterboard. 
Then draw the knife along the cut line for a clean edge on the pile. 
Measure the room to be carpeted. 
Take these measurements to your carpet dealer to make sure you get an ample amount of carpet for your job. 
Bring any drape or paint samples to the carpet dealer for comparison. 
If you've already painted the walls or planned for any other decorating in the room, take in some samples of the colors so you can make an informed choice at the store.
Prepare for the dealer's questions. 
Remember, the decision's up to you. 
Get something that'll serve your purpose, but don't get pushed around into expensive options you don't want.
Select a carpet that will stand up to the concrete. 
Make sure the entire carpet is constructed of synthetic products only. 
If you're not going to install your carpet on a subfloor, you'll need to make sure that you're picking a kind of fiber that will stand up to concrete's tendency to collect moisture.
Consider carpet made from olefin face fiber. 
Decide between lighter and darker carpet. 
Within the general color scheme that you want for the room, select something that will enhance the space and work for the kind of room you want in your home.
Check the room for moisture problems. 
Air out the carpet out before installation. 
Remove any doors for ease of installation. 
Clean the concrete thoroughly, using the appropriate cleaner for the stains you find.
Follow the washing with a mold and bacteria killing solution of 1 part household bleach to 15 parts water. 
Rinse thoroughly with clean water.
Fill in any cracks or imperfections in the surface. Before the surface dries, fill in any holes or cracks, making sure the top of the repair is level with the rest of the concrete surface. 
Use a leveling product to flatten any low spots in the slab.
Control the temperature in the room. 
Lay the tack strip. 
Cut a piece of tack strip the length of one wall, and attach it to the floor with masonry nails. 
Leave a gap the thickness of the carpet's pile between the gripper strip and the wall. 
Lay padding strips. 
Cut padding strips the length of the room, and place them side by side across the room. 
Keep your rows abutted, and cover seams with duct tape. 
Trim any excess with a utility knife.
Cut carpet to size, allowing approximately 6 inches (15.2 cm) excess all around. 
Place seam tape, adhesive side up, where pieces abut. 
Use a steam iron to activate the adhesive and join the pieces together.
Lay carpet out and use a rented knee kicker to force the carpet into the far corner. 
Using the power stretcher, stretch the carpet across the room to the opposite wall. 
Hook the carpet onto the tack strip. 
Continue this until the carpeting is smooth and flat.[4]
Cut off excess carpet, and push carpet behind tack strip, using a wide blade putty knife if necessary. 
Cover edge of carpeting at doorways with metal door jambs and replace doors. 
Finish off with baseboards of your choice.
Put down transition strips as needed. 
When all the cuts have been completed vacuum the floor to remove any debris left behind from fitting. 
Always fix the middle rows and around the perimeter edge by using double sided carpet tape. 
During fitting periodically check the tiles are tight and aligned as a poorly fitted floor can move.

Wait until any building, refurbishment or decorating is complete, then make sure the conditions are right.
comply with British standards
prepare the floor surface
You also need to make sure the room is well ventilated when you’re using adhesives.
Check the surface is dry. 
If the surface is dusty or porous, you’ll need to seal it.
Position the sheets with staggered joints, and nail them at 100-150mm (4-6”) intervals. 
Prime them, and make sure the surface is now smooth, flat, firm and free from all contaminants. 
If you need more detailed information on this, please see the CFA Manual for Installation of Textile Floor Coverings.
If you’re laying carpet over a base of wood blocks, you need to be very careful. 
don’t lay over old floor coverings
You’ll need to take them up, and prepare the surface as described above.
get advice on unusual conditions
Call our technical department on +44 (0) 1924 262525 or email technical@burmatex.co.uk. 
Ensure all the tiles are from the same batch by checking the batch or dye numbers.
DO NOT lay different batches together on the same floor.
Unpack the tiles and condition them for at least 48 hours in the room where you’ll be fitting them.
Check you have the right adhesive. 
Switch off any underfloor heating at least 48 hours before and after you apply the adhesive.
Don’t lay carpet tiles over any underfloor heating where the temperature exceeds 27°C, or on concrete treated with oil-based chemicals.
Then fit the tiles
Plan the installation carefully. 
Draw a chalk line down the centre of the area or from a doorway.
Find the centre point and draw a line at a right angle to the first, as shown in this diagram.
Lay one row of tiles along each leg or cross.
If necessary, re-draw the chalk lines so there’s at least half a tile border along each wall.
Using a v-notched trowel (1/16” x 3/16”) for F3 and F44, or a brush for F41, apply the adhesive evenly over the whole area.
Let the adhesive dry for 30 minutes or longer, depending on humidity and temperature.
Working outwards from the centre of the cross, lay the tiles in position, pressing firmly to ensure they stick properly to the surface.
When fitting tiles at the edge of the room, butt one tile against the skirting, and position the tile to be cut exactly on top of the one immediately behind it, overlapping the butted-up one. 
Where this crosses, mark and cut the top tile. 
If unsure call our technical department on +44 (0)1924 262525, email our team on technical@burmatex.co.uk or check the specifications for each product individually.
Ensure the rolls are from the same batch by checking the batch or dye numbers.
Check you have the right adhesive (see table on back pages).
Switch off any underfloor heating at least 48 hours before and after you apply the adhesive.
Then fit the carpet
Remember to lay all carpet rolls with adjacent pieces in the same direction.
Cut the carpet to the required length plus 5cm (2″).
Lay the first piece lapping up the side and end walls.
Lay the next joining edge in the same way, making sure there’s an overlap of 5cm (2”) on each seam. 
Continue this way until you’ve covered the whole floor.
Fold back the length of all pieces and, holding the trowel at a 60° angle, spread the adhesive evenly to within 20cm (8”) of the seam over an area that can be covered within the open time.
Placing a straight edge along the centre of the overlap, cut through both pieces with a sharp knife and remove the surplus.
Lift the edges of both pieces, apply adhesive, lay the carpet and roll thoroughly with a 68Kg (150lb) roller.

If rain exposure, condensation or any water contact is likely, then all packaging material should be removed.
All materials should be checked for quantity and quality upon receipt.
Aluflam must be contacted immediately of any discrepancies in shipment.
Check to make sure that you have the required supplies and tools necessary for the installation.
Carefully check the openings and surrounding construction that will receive your material.
Remember, if the construction is not per the construction documents, it is your responsibility to notify the general contractor in writing.
Any discrepancies must be brought to the general contractor’s attention before you proceed with the installation.
Collect your shop drawings, materials, packing list, and this installation manual.
Carefully review parts location, the sequence of installation, when you glaze it, and how you seal it.
Consult Aluflam prior to substituting any material to ensure that the products’ fire ratings are not violated.
Remember to isolate, in an approved manner, all aluminum from uncured masonry or other incompatible materials.
If any questions arise concerning Aluflam products or their installation, contact Aluflam for clarification before proceeding.
Take the extra time to wrap and protect the installed material.
Concrete, mortar, plaster, muriatic acid and other alkaline and acid based construction and cleaning materials may be very harmful to framefinishes and should be removed with water and mild soap immediately or permanent damage or staining of the finishes may occur.
All work must start from, and be referenced to benchmarks, offset lines and/or column centerlines established by the architectural drawings and the general contractor.
All frames must be installed plumb, square, level and true, and in accordance with approved shop drawings.
DETERMINE FRAME REFERENCE POINT
Establish the frame reference lines or the exterior/interior plane of the frames to be installed using either bench marks, offset lines, or column centerlines provided by the general contractor and referenced on the shop drawings.
Use the established reference points to determine the installation points for each frame opening at the head, and jambs.
UNPACK FRAME
Remove loose components, such as pressure plates, glass clips, intumescent strips, gaskets, covers, fasteners, etc, and set aside in a well protected area.
Carefully lift frame out of packaging.
Handle the frame with extreme care to avoid separation of corner joints.
In the case of attached, multiple frame sections – assemble the frame sections into larger units prior to installing into the wall opening(see example).
Lay out all frames to be attached on a smooth, dry surface.
Ensure that frames are well protected from abrasion and impact.
Slide horizontal members onto “T” brackets and secure joints through factory pre-drilled holes. 
For exterior applications, follow instructions below:

Cut vertical and horizontal gaskets to length.
Apply CRL Clear 33S Silicone Sealant or equivalent, in corner where the gaskets connect as shown below in Figure 5 and 6.
Install the frame plumb, square, level and true.
Measure the size of the frame and ensure that it meets the dimensions referenced on the shop drawing.
Anchor the frame to surrounding fire-rated structure using structurally sound anchoring method (perimeter bolting, bolted to steel channels, etc.)
Ensure that frame dimensions have not changed.
PREPARE FOR GLAZING
Inspect the factory installed gaskets in the frame opening and make sure it hasn’t shifted during installation.
Make sure intumescent band does not cover the stainless steel setting blocks.
If needed, cut the band.
Place insulating spacers on top of setting blocks.
Make sure that proper tools and lifting capacity is available prior to opening glass crate.

Because each project will have differing conditions, each project should have job specific drawings prepared by journeymen drafters or engineers who are familiar with curtain-wall construction and have an intimate understanding of PRL’s curtain wall system and how to integrate it into the construction details specific to the project it is being used on.
When in doubt contact your PRL technical representative.
Engineering calculations and shop drawing review should be performed by a professional engineer.
Coordinate with your sealant supplier to be sure you are using the correct sealants.
Coordinate with the sealant supplier to be sure of compatibility and adhesion with all curtain wall and building components.
Have your sealant supplier test for compatibility and adhesion with all curtain wall and building components on each project you perform and give you a written report stating that all materials conform.
In each case you must fully clean the surface that the caulking is to adhere to.
It is not always necessary to follow these instructions in the exact order we have suggested but you should be familiar enough with the construction of PRL’s curtain wall should you decide to deviate and specify an alternate order of fabrication and assembly.
When in doubt contact your PRL technical representative.
Isolate and separate aluminum products from steel, masonry and cementitious materials.
Check all shipments from PRL immediately upon receipt thereof.

All you have to do is install the unit into a rough opening.
Follow these steps to install a pre-hung door in your home.
If the unit arrives with a brace to keep the door and frame aligned, leave the brace on until the door unit is plumbed, shimmed and secured into place.
Trim Door Opening
Trim any excess drywall around the doorway to make sure the new door will hang plumb.
Check That Floor is Level
Mark for any shims that are needed under the level.
Determine Where Shims Should Go
Determine Location for Shims
Measure and mark against the jamb where any shims are needed.
Cut the door to the appropriate length.
Remove Door's Temporary Packaging
Remove Packing Material
Remove the plug that comes on the pre-hung door, as well as the temporary trim on the bottom of the door.
Attach Shim to Doorway
Tack one nail on a shim in the doorway to get started.
Place the door inside the opening.

Check and Adjust Door Opening
Use a straight edge to check the door opening, ensuring that it has room to open and close (Image 1).
With the door closed, place a shim by the bottom hinge to accommodate any adjustments (Image 2).
Check Door for Level
Check Top Gap Above Door
Also, check the door again to make sure it is level.
Check the center shim and the gap to make sure the door is plumb.
Nail the door in place, from the jambs through the shims.
Fill Nail Holes
Use a nail set to set the nails beneath the wood, creating a smooth finish.
Fill the holes with spackle.
Check the door to make sure it opens and shuts properly.
Place a level on the vertical surface to check that the door is plumb (Image 1).
If you need to adjust the door, try using a sledgehammer with a very gentle tap.
Place a level on the vertical surface to check that the door is plumb (Image 1).
If you need to adjust the door, try using a sledgehammer with a very gentle tap (Image 2).
Check the floor for level and the jambs for plumb.
Measure the exact amount the floor is off level.
Allow about an hour and a half for your first door, and once you get the hang of it, your next door will go in twice as fast.
When you buy your door, pick up a package of wood shims and 4d, 6d and 8d finish nails.
2x4 and cut another 2x4 the width of your opening (Photo 1) that are both straight as you sight down the edge.
Check it by laying it on a flat surface.
Memorize the bubble's position.
Then flip the level end for end and check the bubble.
If the bubble doesn't settle in the exact spot, find an accurate level.
Check the length of your prehung door jambs.
Use blocks to level jamb bottoms.
If you're installing a door on an unfinished floor and need space under the jambs for carpet, just rest the jambs on temporary blocks while you're hanging the door.
Adjust the size of the blocks so the bottoms of the jambs are on a level plane.
Check the plug.
Make sure the plug that holds the door slab in place is the type that can be removed after the door is installed.
Only shim the top jamb if you're working with a 3-ft.-wide door, and the top jamb arrives bowed from the factory.
Check the floor for level and the jambs for plumb.
Measure the exact amount the floor is off level.
If the floor slopes slightly and the jamb isn't trimmed to compensate, your latch won't line up.
You must check the floor with an accurate level as shown in Photos 1 and 2.
Mark and cut the jamb on the high side with your saw (remove any packaging strips at the bottom of the jambs).
Before you order your door, check the width of your opening.
Also check the vertical sides of the rough opening to make sure they're reasonably plumb.
Checking both sides and getting familiar with any problems with the opening will give you an idea of how much and where to shim the jambs later.
You must check the floor with an accurate level as shown in Photo 1.
For complete directions, just follow our step-by-step photos and instructions.
Cut a 1-ft.
Drop it to the high side of the floor, tack it in place, set your scribe and mark the contour of the floor onto the plywood.
Remove the plywood, cut the shape with a jigsaw and transfer the shape to the bottom of the jamb.
Cut along your mark with a jigsaw.
Do this for each side of the door.
Set the door in place
To hold the doorjamb flush with the drywall before permanently fastening it, attach temporary blocks to both sides of the jamb.
Use scrap lumber to make five 4-in.
Nail three blocks on the latch side and two on the hinge side (the door slab keeps the middle of the hinge side rigid).
Keep the blocks away from the hinges so they won't interfere with shimming.
Follow these steps for a perfect door installation job.
Secure the door in place
Center the frame in the opening.
Slip a shim in from each side of the jamb (make sure the frame is pushed against the cleats) and nail the top sides of the door frame into the trimmer studs.
When the door is in position, nail it into place.
Follow these steps for foolproof installation.
Just get started with Step 1 below to learn how to install an interior door.
If you have a slab door instead and need to hang your door, see this article instead.
1. Buy your door.
Purchase a door to fit the rough opening in the wall.
Start by drawing a plumb line on the wall.
Measure 1/2" in from the rough opening on the hinge side of the door.
Using a 6' or 4' level draw a level line down the drywall.
Attach the door installation brackets.
Attach 6 door installation brackets to the outside of the door jamb, the wood frame to which the door comes pre-attached.
Place a bracket behind each of the three hinges.
Attach the remaining three brackets on the the other side of the jamb.
Place the door into the opening on top of blocks or shims.
Place 1/2" blocks under the door if a carpet or hardwood is going to be installed or 1/4" blocks if installing laminate.
Never place the door directly on an unfinished floor.
Attach the brackets.
Using the plumb line on the wall, screw in the top bracket on the hinge side of the door.
Then screw in the next 2 brackets using the same reference notch as the first bracket.
After the 3 brackets are screwed into the wall using the same reference notch for each, the door is now level.
Now check the reveal (gap between door and door jamb) when screwing in each of the final 3 brackets.
Start at the top of the door and check the reveal when screwing in the top bracket.
Check the reveal when screwing in the final 2 brackets.
Install the casing around the installed door.
Choose casing that compliments your style and cut it using mitered corners or other styles, depending on your preference.
Both the sash replacement kit and the wood or vinyl replacement insert mount inside your existing window jamb, in the place that was occupied by the old sash.
Inspect your old window frame carefully for signs of water damage.
Pay particular attention to the sill.
Probe with a screwdriver to uncover hidden soft spots.
Rot along the top or interior parts of windows, including the window jamb, is more difficult to repair and often signals a bigger problem.
Don't mess with repairs.
Plan on tearing out the entire window and installing a new one.
Measure very carefully before you place an order, no matter what type you install.
Measure the width between the side jambs at the top, middle and bottom and record the smallest measurement.
Measure all the way to the jamb, not the blind stop or parting stop (see Fig.
Now measure the height from the top jamb to the sill (see Fig.
Measure both sides and the middle and record the smallest measurement.
Finally, determine the sill angle (Photo 1) and specify this when you order a sash replacement kit to make sure the jamb liners fit tight to the sill.
Keep a record of all correspondence with your window supplier and ask for a written confirmation before the windows are ordered so you can double-check the sizes.
If the window frame doesn't sit flush with the wall, you'll have to plane and sand the window frame or thicken the jamb depth with furring strips.
So take your time and use a ruler to get the right depth.
Next, measure the rough opening.
Finish by measuring the outer dimensions of the old window frame.
Take all of these numbers with you when you go shopping, and know that you can custom-order odd sizes if no stock sizes fit your opening.
Ask your window dealer for help measuring, though, since you'll have to downsize the window slightly to fit.
Make sure to inspect and operate an actual working model of the window before you order.
Then consider the overall appearance.
Measure diagonally.
If the diagonal measurements differ by more than 1/2 in., the new sash won't seal properly and you should replace the window or use a vinyl replacement window instead.
Contact the manufacturer for more information about options and to find out where to order windows in your area.
Photo 1: Pry against a stiff putty knife to protect the wood.
To minimize paint chipping on painted windows, score the joint between the window frame and stop with a utility knife before prying off the stop.
Pull the nails through the backside of the stop with a nail nipper or pliers.
Complete the window prep by following Photos 2 and 3.
Start your replacement insert installation by removing the interior stop, sash and parting stop.
Use a pliers (Photo 3) to break out the lower section.
If the upper sash is stuck, pry or break out the upper section of parting stop with a chisel.
If your windows have spring balances or metal jamb liners rather than sash weights like ours, start by removing the interior stops (Photo 1).
Then look for the screws or nails that secure the sash hardware and remove them.
If your window has a sash weight cavity, stuff it with insulation.
Make sure your window insert is square
Don't be afraid to remove the screws and readjust the window in the opening if necessary.
In addition to checking the window by measuring the diagonals (Photo 5), open and close the sashes to make sure the tops and bottoms are parallel with the sill and top jamb and that the top and bottom sashes are parallel to each other where they meet in the middle.
Keep tweaking the shims until everything is square and lined up.
Then snug but don't overtighten the screws.
Complete the installation by reinstalling the interior stops (Photo 7) and sealing up the exterior (Photos 8 and 9).
Be sure to read the installation instructions that come with each window.
Before disturbing any surface, get a lab analysis of paint chips from it.
Contact your public health department for information on how to collect samples and where to send them.
Lay a protractor (Fig.B) on the folded paper to determine the angle.
Then measure the interior height and width of the window frame.
Use these measurements to order your sash replacement kit.
Then replace the interior stops and top parting stop (Photo 6).
Read the instructions included with your window for the exact procedure to use for lowering the sash lifts (Photo 7) and tilting the sash into place.
If you have trouble pushing in the sash after you tilt it up, try working with one side at a time.
Compress the jamb liner with one hand while you ease one top corner of the sash in with the other.
Then repeat the process on the other side.
Also position the top of the sash toward the center of the opening.
Have the necessary tools for this DIY project lined up before you startâ€"you'll save time and frustration.
Avoid last-minute shopping trips by having all your materials ready ahead of time.
Follow these instructions to successfully remove an old window and install a new one in its place.
Remove Window Trim and Casing
Remove Old Window/Guide Track
Unscrew the window from the jamb and remove it.
Take care not to break the glass while removing.
With the window out of the wall, inspect the condition of the window jamb to make sure there is no structural damage.
Inspect/Replace Window Stop
Dry Fit Window
Before applying the silicone to the the window stop, dry fit the window to make sure there are no fitment issues.
When done properly the window should fit snugly into the opening.
Do not move forward with the install until you are satisfied with the way the window fits in the opening.
Adding cedar chips to under part of new window installation to keep things level.
Close up of a drill making a hole for a screw in the side of the window.
Install Window
First, run a bead of silicone on the inside edge of the window stop (Image 1) and then slide the window into place (Image 2).
Place a level across the top of the window and press cedar shims between the bottom of the window frame and the jamb as necessary to get the window sitting level (Image 3).
For larger gaps, cut pieces of roll insulation and pack them into the gaps.
Add Extension Jambs and Trim Molding
Pick a style of molding that fits your home's decor and create a frame around the window.
Measure the length of each piece and use a miter saw to cut the trim to the appropriate length.
Make your cuts on 45-degree angles so the trim will fit together with a nice picture-frame look.
Attach the trim to the wall with finish nails.
At first, use only enough nails to hold the trim to the wall until you've successfully lined up all four sides of the frame.
Once you've achieved the proper fit and you're sure the trim will not require additional adjustments to fit, you can go back and add more finish nails, every 6 to 8 inches.
Install a Replacement Window
Measure for the New Window
Take all measurements from inside your home.
To find the width, measure from the inside of the jamb on one side of the window to the inside of the jamb on the other side of the window.
Measure at the bottom, middle and top of the window.
Use the narrowest measurement for the width of your replacement window.
To find the height, measure from the top of the sill to the bottom of the window's head jamb.
Measure at the left, middle and right of the window.
Use the shortest measurement for the height of your replacement window.
Remove the Old Window Sashes
Remove old windows.
Since the replacement windows fit inside the existing window frame, you only have to remove the sashes, parting bead and inside stop from the existing window.
To make the project easier and safer, install your new windows from inside your home.
Remove the inside stop pieces from the window.
Take care when removing these pieces; you'll reuse them when installing the new windows.
Remove the inside sash.
If the old window uses weights, cut the sash cords or chains.
Let the weights fall to the bottom of their wells, and simply leave them there.
Slide the outside sash to the bottom of the window.
Remove and discard the parting beads.
Remove the outside sash in the same manner as the inside sash.
Don't remove the exterior stop from the window jambs.
Clean the window jambs and sill thoroughly.
If the old window had weights, either drive the pulleys into the frame or remove them entirely.
Fill any holes in the jambs or sill with caulk.
Install the New Window
Install new window.
Lay a bead of caulk along the inside of the outside stops on the jambs.
Mark the sill for the sill angle.
Center the top and bottom sashes vertically in the new window frame.
Slide the bumper stops toward the center of the frame until the four mounting holes in the side jambs (two top and two bottom) are visible.
Place the window in the opening and check for square.
If the window isn't square in the opening, shim as needed to square it.
Install the mounting screws at the top and bottom of each side jamb.
Don't install the screws so tightly that they deform the side jambs.
Slide the top and bottom sashes up and down to check for gaps and smooth operation.
If the sashes don't operate smoothly, use the built-in adjustment screws in the side jambs to adjust the window frame.
Caulk the inside of the window and reinstall the inside stops.
Remove trees, debris, and other items from the building location.
Smooth and level the ground where the foundation is to be made.
Construct the foundation using the materials recommended by your concrete contractor.
Check the anchor bolt plan thoroughly upon receipt.
Check the concrete forms and anchor bolt locations prior to the pouring of the concrete.
A final check should be made after the completion of the concrete work and prior to the steel erection.
Refer to your anchor bolt drawing for proper sizes and dimensions.
When the truck arrives with the building, unload the truck promptly, stack the steel parts evenly on blocks and protect them from the weather.
Protect painted parts from moisture to prevent fading and discoloring and stack the structural steel parts so they will be straight.
1. Check each part against the delivery receipt.
2. Sign the delivery receipt if all parts are delivered.
3. If any of the parts are missing, notify the driver and note the missing items on the delivery receipt before signing.
4. Check with your salesperson regarding the missing parts.
All primer should be touched up as required before erection.
Place the parts around the foundation so they will be in the most convenient locations for installation.
For example: place the end columns and rafters at the ends of the building and the mainframe columns and rafters at the sides.
Place the bolts and nuts in a place where they will be accessible to the parts.
3. If the bundles are to be lifted with a crane, use a spreader bar of appropriate length and nylon band slings (do not use wire rope slings as they will damage the material).
4. Depending on the panel length, some bundles may be lifted by a forklift.
Never drag or slide one sheet over another sheet.
Instead, lift the sheet along its longitudinal edge and carry in a vertical position.
Use safety lines and nets when necessary!
Always assume panel surface is slippery and act accordingly.
2. When stored on bare ground, place a plastic ground cover under the bundles to minimize condensation on the sheets from ground moisture.
3. Store bundles at least 12 inches above ground level to allow air circulation beneath the bundle, and to prevent damage from rising water.
4. Elevate one end of each bundle slightly to permit runoff of moisture from the top of the bundle or from between sheets.
5. Inspect stored bundles daily and repair any tears or punctures in the waterproof cover.
6. Re-cover opened bundles at the end of each workday to prevent subsequent moisture damage.
Check each order carefully, as it is unloaded.
If damage or shortages are noted after delivery (at time of unpacking) notify your Mueller representative immediately.
Have invoice numbers and detailed descriptions of the damage or shortage available.
Never Install Material if the quality is in question!
Consult the project engineer, not Mueller, Inc.
Complete set of Wrenches (Open-end,
After the columns have been erected, the ground-assembled rafter is hoisted into place and connected to the columns.
To reduce the severe compression stresses at the ridge of the rafters that are created by the angle of lifting cables, a spreader bar is recommended, which allows the lifting cables to be parallel to each other.
Remember, SAFETY FIRST!
When the rafters consist of several roof beams, as in the case of wide buildings, a safe procedure of raising by sections and supporting the free end must be followed, regardless of the type of equipment available.
should be assembled on the ground with the bolts left finger tight.
During this erection process, the frame must be properly braced or guyed before the lifting lines are disengaged.
To lend overall rigidity to the structure, install flange braces to the purlins at specified locations.
Note: Take precautions to secure structure during assembly.
Never leave the structure unbraced.
Turn-of-the-nut method - When turn-of-the-nut method is used to provide tension, first bring enough bolts to a "snug tight" condition to ensure that the parts of the joints are brought into good contact with each other.
Next, place bolts in all remaining bolt holes and bring to "snug tight".
Then additionally tighten all bolts - progressing from the bolts nearest the web, to the free edges.
During this operation there shall be no rotation of the part not turned by the wrench.
Consult latest edition of the AISC Manual of Steel Construction for more complete instructions for installing high strength bolts.
Insert grip through eyebolt.
Begin wrapping the grip around the cable, matching the crossover marks.
Continue until the lasts two wraps are left split the legs and apply separately.
Duplicate this procedure on each end.
Obtain the proper tension of the strand by tightening the nuts on the eyebolts.
2. Insert the "T" section on an angle through slot until round neck rests on web plate then turn brace-eye 90 degrees.
3. Then pull brace-eye toward you until "T" section rests against back of web plate, square neck locks brace-eye in place.
4. Attach the brace-grip to the brace-eye and then attach the brace grip to the cable.
Assemble the next brace cable the same way and connect to the next column to form an "X" with the other cable.
To square the building, measure the length of the diagonals and tighten or loosen the turnbuckle/eye-bolt until the lengths are the same.
Double-check by using a square at the corners.
Brace each sidewall frame the same way so that you have an x-brace on each side.
Tighten the column anchor nuts after ensuring that the building is square.
Occasionally the bracing in the wall of a building cannot be installed in the specified bay because of doors or other complications.
However, before moving any wind bracing check with Mueller, Inc.
Do not remove after building is erected.
Note: Never modify a Mueller building without first contacting a Mueller representative.

(Consult Your Specific Requirements Prior To Installation).
Do not overdrive fasteners!
Before starting the wall installation, check to be sure that the eave strut and girts are straight and plumb.
Refer to the cross section framing drawing that accompanied the building to determine the girt spacing.
Use 1/8" or 5/32" diameter drill bit for panel to structural fasteners and a 1/4" diameter bit for the sidelap clearance holes.
Be sure there is no excessive deflection in the purlins and girts.
Check building erection drawings.
Check for proper coverage (3' center to center) and correct as necessary.
Install remaining fasteners.
Note: Start first panel with major rib centered with endwall frame.
Drive the fastener in until it is tight and the washer is firmly seated.
Do not overdrive fasteners: A slight extrusion of neoprene around the washer is a good visual tightness check.
Always use the proper tool to install fasteners.
Discard worn sockets, these can cause the fastener to wobble during installation.
Note: Always remove metal shavings from surface of panels at the end of each work period.
Sealant tape should not be stretched when installed.
Apply only to clean, dry surfaces.
Keep only enough sealant tape on the roof that can be installed in a day.
During warm weather, store sealant tape in a cool dry place.
During cold weather (below 60 degrees) sealant tape must be kept warm (60 degrees - 90 degrees) until application.
After sealant tape has been applied, keep protective paper in place until panel is ready to be installed.
Never step on a single unsecured roof panel, or a stack of roof panels laying unattached on the purlins.
Secure each end of the panel with clamps or appropriate fasteners and place walk boards of adequate size and strength in the flat of any panels not fully secured to the purlins and supported by panels on each side.
Cut a groove in the bottom of each board so the board will lie flat and not tip back and forth because of the rope.
When on the roof, use OSHA approved protection devices such as safety lines, safety nets or catch platforms.
After installing the first run of insulation, prepare the eave for the first roof panel by applying sealant tape along the eave outside of the insulation and leaving release paper in place.
Sealant must be applied in a straight line and without voids.

Complete the seal using common weatherresistant fasteners.
When using pipe flash on very steep pitched roof or surface with deep corrugation, use next largest size for increased flange flexibility.
Note: Specify Neoprene when Pipe Flash is to be exposed to petrochemicals.
In this method the surface is cleaned using an oxy-acetylene torch which works on the principle of differential thermal expansion between steel and mill scale.
Following surface preparation, cutting to length is always the first process to be carried out, and this is done by any of the following methods.
The cut produced by plasma jet is very clean and its quality can be improved by using a water injection arc plasma torch.
When a section cannot be cut to length by cropping or shearing, then it is normally sawn.
In order to reduce the effect of strain hardening and the consequent reduction in ductility of material around punched holes, smaller size (2 mm to 4 mm lesser than final size) holes are punched and subsequently reamed to the desired size.
Therefore before attempting further fabrication the material should be straightened.
Upon cooling, the subsequent shrinkage produces a shortening of the member, thus pulling it back into alignment.
Before final assembly, the component parts of a member are fitted-up temporarily with rivets, bolts or small amount of welds.
The cutting head moves along the edge of the plate, planing it to a neat and smooth finish.
The corrosion protection afforded by metallic coating largely depends upon the surface preparation, the choice of coating and its thickness.
The steel reacts with molten zinc to form a series of zinc or iron alloys on its surface.
The metal, in powder or wire form, is fed through a special spray gun containing a heat source, which can be either an oxy-gas flame or an electric arc.
The finishing coats provide the first-line defence against the environment and also determine the final appearance in terms of gloss, colour etc.
The metal melted from each member of the joint unites in a pool of molten metal, which bridges the interface.
Confirm by Magnetic Particle
Fill by weld deposit.
Fill and grind smooth.
Flange across curvature
In the case of field assembly using bolts the number of washers for the permanent bolts should not be more than two (and not less than one) for the nuts and one for the bolt head.
In the case of field assembly by welding almost all the precautions needed for shop welding may be followed.
In the case of High Strength Friction Grip (HSFG) bolts the material surfaces should be absolutely free from grease, lubricant, dust, rust etc and shall be thoroughly cleaned before assembling.
After tightening the bolt heads, nuts and edges of the mating, surfaces should be sealed with a coat of paint to obviate entry of moisture.
When a weld pool has been formed and the end of the stud is melted the latter is automatically forced into the steel plate and the current is switched off.
When a weld such as a butt weld is completed and begins to cool the hot weld and parent metal contracts longitudinally.
Presetting the flange plate at an angle initially as shown in Fig.5 and Fig.6 may reduce the angular rotation due to a single fillet.
When the welds are made manually, it is customary to put the stiffeners into the girder before the web/flange welds are made; in this way the square profile of the web to flange is maintained.
Where automatic welding is employed the stiffeners cannot be put first since they would impede the progress of the automatic machine; in this presetting of the flange plates may be required.
Welding should preferably be started at the centre of the fabrication and all succeeding welds from the centre outwards.
On cooling, the area contracts and the element then becomes shorter,  this principle can be used to correct or induce any curvature.
If the defects are within acceptable limits, they are accepted.
In order to ensure that the fabrication can be carried out in accordance with the drawings, it is necessary that inspection and checking is carried out in accordance with an agreed Quality Assurance Plan (QAP).
Before erection the fabricated materials should be verified at site with respect to mark numbers, key plan and shipping list.
Care also should be taken so that steel structural components should not come in contact with earth or accumulated water.
Erection should be carried out with the help of maximum possible mechanisation.
Such tests if needed may be repeated at intermediate stages also.
After erection, the joint should be made by filling not less than 50% of the holes with bolts.
The holes that need enlargement to admit bolts or rivets should be reamed only after carefully examining the extent of the inaccuracy and the effect on the soundness of the structure.
Such holes must not be formed by gas cutting process.
The contact surfaces in HSFG connection if painted will develop lesser friction and this should have been accounted for in design.
For connections to be done by welding, the components should be securely held in position to ensure alignment, camber etc., before welding is commenced.
The involvement of all players at an early stage is critical to a precast project.
The fundamental mindset of all professionals has to be changed to achieve "Total Building Performance".

Photo 1: Check the floor
The opposite jamb must be cut by this much to level the door in the opening.
You'll also need to pick up a lockset for the door even though we won't cover the installation in this article.
You may have to trim both sides to minimize the space under the door.
In most cases, the door should clear the floor by 1/2 in.
If it's not, sometimes you can cut off the plastic strap and insert the plug back in through the doorknob hole.
Photo 1: Check the floor
The opposite jamb must be cut by this much to level the door in the opening.
If you're installing a door on a finished floor and the floor isn't level, you'll have to cut a little off the bottom of one of the jambs.
Step 2: Check Your Rough Opening Carefully and Prepare the Door Before Starting
Photo 2: Trim the jamb
If you cut more than 1/4 in. from the jamb, you may need to trim the bottom of the door so it conforms to the floor slope.
Scribe the jamb
Photo 7: Attach temporary blocks to the jamb

The jamb should be perpendicular to your temporary cleats.
Be careful not to twist the jamb as you nail it.
2. Start getting things straightened out.
You can also use a laser level, which may be easier and more accurate (there are many models that can attach to a wall).
Step 1: Measure carefully
You can replace a drafty old window in just a few hours, but first you have to get accurate measurements to order the new one.
Look closely at details like the locking system, weatherstripping, and sash and frame joints.
Step 1: Gently pry off the interior stops
You can also install wood or vinyl replacement inserts in casement and sliding window jambs.
Step 1: Determine the bottom angle of the sash
Photo 1: Align the edge of a heavy piece of paper with the window stop and fold the bottom to match the angle of the sill.
You have to pry off the stop (carefully for reuse) and the parting stop (which you can discard; see Photo 3).
You can either nail or screw the new liner clips in place (Photo 4).
Be sure to leave a 1/16-in.
The first thing to do is to use a prybar to remove the window trim and jamb extension from around the old window.

Before the Mueller prefabricated steel building arrives, the site and foundation should be prepared.
If you have any questions, call your Mueller Steel Building Systems Salesperson.
It is extremely important that anchor bolts be placed accurately in accordance with the anchor bolt setting plan.
All anchor bolts should be held in place with a template or similar means, so they will remain plumb and in the correct location during placing of the concrete.
All obstructions, overhead and otherwise, must be removed and the access route graveled or planked if the soil will not sustain the heavy wheel loads.
You may want to screw the bolts and nuts together and place them with the corresponding parts.
This will save time as you begin assembling the parts.
1. Bundles should remain banded (if possible) during the unloading process.
Bundles should never be lifted by the banding material.
2. Lift each bundle as close as possible to its center of gravity.
When using a forklift, the forks should be spread to their maximum spacing, and the load centered on the forks.
5. After panel bundles are opened, individual sheets must be handled carefully to prevent panel buckling or damage to the panel coating.
When removing a sheet from a bundle it should be rolled off the bundle to prevent scratching of the next sheet.
Sheets should not be picked up by the ends.
Packages of sheets should be lifted off the truck with extreme care taken to ensure that no damage occurs to ends of the sheets or to side ribs.
The packages should be stored off the ground sufficiently high to allow air circulation underneath the packages.
Caution: Care should always be taken when walking on panels.
1. The storage area should be reasonably level, and located so as to minimize handling.
A waterproof cover should be placed over the bundles to allow for air circulation under the cover.
Report any obvious damage or shortages to the carrier immediately.
The flange brace should be bolted to the rafter prior to raising in order to save time.
The hoisting equipment should never be released from the rafter until the frame is adequately braced, so it cannot buckle or tip in the longitudinal direction of the building.
Note: Stay well in the clear of loads being moved by any lifting device.
Note that the diagonal lengths may vary between the two walls, but should be the same on each x-brace.
It should always be installed as shown on the erection drawing and should be tensioned so that the building will not sway or rock when the wind blows.
The workman should watch the structural members carefully as he tightens the bracing.
The erector should review this requirement, and the erector should provide any additional bracing.
One side of the blanket insulation should have a vapor barrier that must face the inside of the building regardless of whether the insulation is for heating or cooling.
Note: Do not install more insulation on the roof than can be covered by roof panels before the work period ends.
Note: Always wear rubber sole work boots!
Along the top of the closures that have been placed along the eave, apply a second run of sealant tape.
Note: For a professional finish, roof panel ribs should be in line with wall panel ribs.
3. When possible, install panels such that sidelaps are nested away from prevailing winds.
1. Step on rib at edge of panel.
2. Step near crease in rib at edge of panel.
3. Step within 5 feet of edge on unsecured panel.
Always wear gloves when handling sheet metal.
Peak sheet ridge panels are to be installed as each side of the roof is sheeted.
Note: Do not walk on unsecured ends of panels.
