GENERAL NOTES
1.Do not drop, roll or drag boxes of aluminum framing.
Move and stack boxes with proper support to prevent distortion.
If forklifts are used, be especially careful about striking the boxes when lifting or moving.
2.Store in a dry, out of the way area.
If rain exposure, condensation or any water contact is likely, then all packaging material should be removed.
Wet packagingmaterials will discolor and may stain aluminum finishes and paints.
3.All materials should be checked for quantity and quality upon receipt.
Aluflam must be contacted immediately of any discrepancies in shipment.
Check to make sure that you have the required supplies and tools necessary for the installation.
4.Carefully check the openings and surrounding construction that will receive your material.
Remember, if the construction is not per the construction documents, it is your responsibility to notify the general contractor in writing.
Any discrepancies must be brought to the general contractor's attention before you proceed with the installation.
5.Collect your shop drawings, materials, packing list, and this installation manual.
Carefully review parts location, the sequence of installation, when you glaze it, and how you seal it.
Installation instructions are of a general nature and may not address every condition you will encounter.
The shop drawings were prepared specifically for the project.
6.Any material substitutions must be of equal or greater quality.
Consult Aluflam prior to substituting any material to ensure that the products' fire ratings are not violated.
7.Remember to isolate, in an approved manner, all aluminum from uncured masonry or other incompatible materials.
8.System-to-structure fasteners are not supplied by Aluflam.
Fasteners called out on shop drawings are to indicate minimum sizes.
9.If any questions arise concerning Aluflam products or their installation, contact Aluflam for clarification before proceeding.
10.Aluflam product installation is frequently completed before drywall, flooring and other products.
Take the extra time to wrap and protect the installed material.
11.Cutting tolerances are ± 1/32", unless otherwise specified.
12.Concrete, mortar, plaster, muriatic acid and other alkaline and acid based construction and cleaning materials may be very harmful to framefinishes and should be removed with water and mild soap immediately or permanent damage or staining of the finishes may occur.
A spot test is recommended before any cleaning agent is used, and abrasive type cleaners must never be used.
13.Frames are never to be used as ladders, step stools, scaffolds or scaffold supports.
14.All work must start from, and be referenced to benchmarks, offset lines and/or column centerlines established by the architectural drawings and the general contractor.
15.All frames must be installed plumb, square, level and true, and in accordance with approved shop drawings.
16.Glass and glazing building codes governing the design and use of products vary widely.
Aluflam North America, LLC does not control the selection of the products, product configurations, operating hardware and function, or glazing materials, and Aluflam assumes no responsibility for these design considerations.
It is the responsibility of the design professional, owner, architect, specifier, general contractor, and the installer to make these selections in strict accordance with all applicable codes.
INSTALLATION
STEPS
1. DETERMINE FRAME REFERENCE POINT
Establish the frame reference lines or the exterior/interior plane of the frames to be installed using either bench marks, offset lines, or column centerlines provided by the general contractor and referenced on the shop drawings.
Use the established reference points to determine the installation points for each frame opening at the head, and jambs.
2. UNPACK FRAME
a.Remove loose components, such as pressure plates, glass clips, intumescent strips, gaskets, covers, fasteners, etc, and set aside in a well protected area.
b.Carefully lift frame out of packaging.
At this point, the frame joints are unprotected.
Handle the frame with extreme care to avoid separation of corner joints.
3. MULTIPLE FRAMES
a.In the case of attached, multiple frame sections - assemble the frame sections into larger units prior to installing into the wall opening(see example).
b.Lay out all frames to be attached on a smooth, dry surface.
Ensure that frames are well protected from abrasion and impact.
Strips of wood are very suitable for this purpose.
c."T" brackets are factory installed to the vertical mullions in accordance with shop drawings.
d.Slide horizontal members onto "T" brackets and secure joints through factory pre-drilled holes. 
NOTE:
For exterior applications, follow instructions below:
Apply CRL Clear 33S Silicone Sealant or equivalent, to surfaces as shown in Figure 1 and 2 below:
Slide horizontal members onto "T" brackets as shown in Figure 3.
Secure joints through factory pre-drilled holes as shown in Figure 4:
Wipe of excess silicone as needed.
Cut vertical and horizontal gaskets to length.
Apply CRL Clear 33S Silicone Sealant or equivalent, in corner where the gaskets connect as shown below in Figure 5 and 6.
4. INSTALLATION OF FRAME
a.Install the frame plumb, square, level and true.
b.Measure the size of the frame and ensure that it meets the dimensions referenced on the shop drawing.
c.Anchor the frame to surrounding fire-rated structure using structurally sound anchoring method (perimeter bolting, bolted to steel channels, etc.)
d.Ensure that frame dimensions have not changed.
5. PREPARE FOR GLAZING
a.Inspect the factory installed gaskets in the frame opening and make sure it hasn't shifted during installation.
b.Make sure intumescent band does not cover the stainless steel setting blocks.
If needed, cut the band.
See Figure 7.
c.Place insulating spacers on top of setting blocks.
See Figure 8.
6. GLAZING
The Swissflam and Contraflam glass products that are used in Aluflam frame systems are heavy and fragile.
Make sure that proper tools and lifting capacity is available prior to opening glass crate.
Avoid impact with any metal objects and avoid setting the glass down directly onto floor.
Use wood strips or other suitable material for setting down the glass section prior to installation.
For full instructions on handling and installing glass, please refer to Vetrotech Saint-Gobain's installation instructions.
a)Center the glass in the frame opening and carefully set the unit down onto the setting blocks.
b)While supporting glass in place, secure it by fastening stainless steel glass clips at pre-drilled locations. 
NOTE - THE STAINLESS STEEL GLASS CLIPS ARE KEY TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ALUFLAM CURTAINWALL SYSTEM AND MUST BE INSTALLED. 
c)Attach pressure plates at pre-drilled locations.
NOTE - CENTER THE PRESSURE PLATES SO THE GASKET OVERLAP THE STAINLESS GLASS CLIPS ON BOTH SIDES. FAILURE TO DO SO CAN RESULT IN LEAKAGE.
d)Snap on covers.
NOTE:
For exterior applications, follow instructions below:
Apply CRL Clear 33S Silicone Sealant or equivalent into pre-drilled holes for glass clips. 
7. FINISHING
a.Fill gaps around frame with mineral wool insulating material.
Pack as tightly as possible.
b.Finish gaps by applying a continuous bead of silicone caulking. Use 3M Fire Barrier Sealant CP 25WB or equivalent.
c.Clean glass units using mild glass cleaner.
