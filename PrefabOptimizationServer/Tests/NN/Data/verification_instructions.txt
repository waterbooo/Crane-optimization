If you're lucky, you'll just have a plain cement floor in a brand-new house and all you'll need to do is vacuum. 
If you're unlucky (as I was with our example corridor), you'll need to remove an old and worn carpet first. 
Like any floor tiling project, you should lay out the tiles and ensure they're cut to fit before attaching them. 
Best practice is generally deemed to start laying from the centre of the room (which you can identify by measuring both walls and calculating the location, or by running a string or chalk line diagonally between each corner). 
Either way, however, you should lay tiles one at a time until you"ve filled the area.
Fit them together as tightly as possible; you don't want any gaps.
You can do this using a sharp Stanley-style knife and a metal ruler. 
For simple square edges, work out where to cut by overlapping the tile until it fits, mark the area and then cut. 
For more complex corners, you may want to trace a paper template using a pencil beforehand.
Lift each tile individually, apply the adhesive, then fit tightly back in place. 
Find below the installation guide for carpet tiles and rugs.
Sweep and/or vacuum the floor as required. 
For a conventional broadloom appearance the tiles would be laid so that the arrows point in the same direction. 
However many Heuga ranges can be installed in a variety of ways to achieve the desired effect - i.e. quarter turn, brick, ashlar or even non directional. 
When cutting tiles in to smaller sizes please make sure you mark the direction of the pile on the back of the cut tiles that lose the arrows
Determine the centre of the room by measuring the room's length and width.
For each measurement mark using a chalk line and the centre of the room is the point where the two lines intersect at right angles. 
Before you start to think about laying your Heuga tiles you should check the number of full tiles and the size of part tiles required to reach the walls in each direction. 
It may be necessary to offset the centre point to ensure that the perimeter tiles are at least half-size or larger and of similar proportions at opposite ends of the room.
When drawing a chalk line ensure the line is parallel to the walls. 
To do this measure out from the wall near each end of the room, mark the points on the floor and draw the line between the points. 
Do this for both the length and width measurements and the resulting quadrants should meet at right angles
From the starting point, install one row of tiles accurately and firmly along each of the lines to create two crossed rows of tiles. 
Lay the first tile into the right angle formed by crossing the lines and continue to lay the tiles along the main line up to the perimeter.
With the tile face down accurately measure and mark the tile on the backing. 
Using a Stanley knife and straight edge cut through the backing. 
Fit the perimeter cut with the manufactured edge adjoining the last complete tile and the cut edge against the wall. 
Always begin from the centre and work uniformly outwards towards the walls. 
At the anchor rows periodically check that the edges of the tiles remain along the lines. 
Particular care should be taken to ensure that tiles are tightly butted together with the backing of adjacent tiles touching. 
Also ensure that pile is not caught at the joint.
When creating your rug the arrows of all tiles should point in the same direction.
Find the design you would like to create in these instructions. 
Look carefully at the design to see exactly how the tiles should be installed.
Use a sharp carpet knife and a metal straight edge to cut the smaller tiles in your design to the right size. 
Turn the tile with the backing facing upwards and cut it from the back. Crack the tile from behind and cut through the top fibre from behind. 
When cutting half and quarter tiles, please make sure you mark the direction of the pile on the back of the cut tiles that lose the arrows. 
Sort out the tiles and put the design together without fixing permanently to make sure you are happy with the design. 
Attach the tiles together using the TacTiles; make sure you fit the tiles closely together. 
Vacuum your rug and it's ready! 
For more detailed instructions on how to maintain your Heuga rug, please go the product care section-carpet tiles.
Lay carpet tiles 
Cut the door jamb
Use a pry bar and timber block to remove all skirting boards. 
Lay a carpet tile offcut on the floor and use a sharp handsaw to undercut the architrave and doorjamb, creating a recess for the carpet to slip under.
Check the starting corner
Choose a starting corner for laying the carpet tiles using the 3-4-5 method to check for square. 
Measure and mark 900 and 1200mm along adjacent walls from the corner. 
The distance between the two marks should be 1500mm.
Lay the carpet tiles
Position the first row of carpet tiles along the selected wall butted tightly together, then continue laying rows, keeping the carpet grain consistent. 
Check the laying arrow under each tile points in the same direction
Cut the carpet tiles
Sketch full-size templates of doors and other tiling obstacles on thin cardboard, marking the cutout from the carpet tiles already laid. 
Position the carpet tile and template, cutting using a straightedge and utility knife.
Finish the carpet tiling
Work the cut carpet tile carefully into position around the obstacle, checking all edges are butted neatly with the surrounding tiles. 
Trim where necessary then finish laying any remaining carpet tiles.
Secure the skirting
Clamp the skirting and mitre one side of each internal corner at 45ยบ with a compound mitresaw. 
Cut along the profile with a coping saw, removing the internal mitre so the skirting butts against the face of the adjacent trim.
Peel and stick carpet tiles offer numerous benefits. 
Vacuum your subfloor and make sure it is free of all dirt, debris, residue and grease.
Measure each of your walls with a tape measure and mark the midpoints. 
Snap a chalk line between the midpoint of each wall and the opposite wall so that the two chalk lines cross each other in the middle of your room. 
Place a framing square at the intersection of the chalk lines, checking that they are exactly perpendicular. 
Lay out the carpet squares in a dry run to ensure you have tiles at least half a tile wide along the borders. 
Adjust the room's chalk lines if necessary.
Start in one of the four sections of your room created by the intersecting chalk lines. 
Remove the backing of a carpet tile and carefully lay it in the corner of the section created by the chalk lines. 
Continue placing carpet tiles adjacent to the first one until you've filled the first section. 
Consult the arrows on the back of the tile to see which way the carpet nap lies, and place each tile so that the nap runs perpendicular to the tile next to it. 
Lay tiles this way in each section until you've covered the whole floor.
Measure carpet tiles to cut so they will fit along the edges of your room. 
Place a loose tile upside down on the installed tile closest to the wall. 
Place a guide tile upside down on top of the loose tile and slide it over so that it touches the wall. 
Draw a line along the edge of the guide tile onto the middle tile with a felt-tipped pen.
Place the marked tile on a piece of cardboard and a place metal straightedge along the marked line. 
Cut along the line with a utility knife as many times as needed until you cut through the base of the tile. 
Bend the tile slightly along the cut and continue cutting until you've cut through all the carpet. 
Trim loose loops of carpet away with a pair of scissors.
Lay your cut tile on the floor with the backing still on to make sure it fits snugly against the wall. 
Remove the backing and lay it carefully.
Roll over the entire floor with a 100-pound roller after you have installed all the edge tiles.
Read and understand the instructions and inspect the wall conditions before you begin.

D. Bend each end of the center panel up.
E. Install the sill pan by sliding into place until the exterior sill pan lip is flush with the exterior of the rough opening.
F. Apply sill flashing tape. 
Cut a piece of flashing tape 2" longer than the opening width. 
Apply at the bottom of the opening, covering the exterior sill pan lip as shown.
Note: If applicable, apply spray adhesive to building felt prior to applying the flashing tape.
G. Cut two 9" pieces of flashing tape with a 1" x 3"tab at the bottom, on opposite corners as shown.
H. Apply the tabbed 9" pieces of flashing tape. 
I. Cut two 6" pieces of flashing tape and apply to each side of the rough opening, overlapping the first piece by 1" and lapping the bottom over the side flange of the sill pan as shown.
J. Cut a piece of flashing tape to the width of the opening. 
Install to the flanges of the sill pan and overlap the tape from step 1N by 1". 
If needed add a second or third piece of flashing tape until the sill pan is covered to the interior sill pan lip.
K. Cut two pieces of flashing tape 1-1/2" x 6" and apply to the bottom corners of the opening by beginning in the corner of the sill pan, with 3/4" of the tape applied to the sill pan and 3/4" of the tape applied to the side flange. 
The remainder of the tape is to be at a 45 degree angle onto the exterior.
L. Attach the aluminum sill support or wood blocking to the exterior of the box plate to support the edge of the door sill. 
Place the sill support flush with the subfloor.
Locate the new wall.
Attach a top plate to the ceiling framing.
Use a plumb bob to position a bottom ( sole ) plate directly beneath the top plate, and nail it to the floor.
Install wall studs between the top and bottom plates on 16- or 24-inch centers.
Nail or screw drywall to the studs and plates.
Apply cornerbead, drywall tape and compound to hide the joints and fasteners.
Fasten drywall sheets to studs horizontally, then tape and fill joints.
After you finish the framing, refer to the links above right for the techniques used for cutting and attaching drywall or paneling. 
If this looks like the work will be beyond your skills or if you don't have the necessary tools, hire a framing contractor or carpenter to do the work.
To begin, mark the center line of the new wall across the ceiling. 
Then measure and mark half the width of the new wall's top plate in each direction. 
Snap a chalk line between these marks. 
Plan one stud at each end and, if an end meets a wall, measure 15 1/4 inches to locate the inside edge of the first intermediate stud and then 16 inches to the same edge of each additional stud.
Start with the top and bottom plates.
1On the floor, lay the top and bottom plates side by side. 
Carefully measure where each wall stud will go and mark perpendicular lines across the plates, using a combination square so the studs will align perfectly.
Install the top plate.
Locate the joists in the ceiling (here we've shown the drywall on the ceiling removed for clarity's sake). 
Hold the top plate in position along the guideline marked on the ceiling and nail through the ceiling material and into each joist with two 3 1/2-inch nails. 
(If the new wall runs parallel to the joists, fasten the plate to nailing blocks installed between the joists.)
Install the bottom plate.
Hang a plumb bob from each end of the top plate on the ceiling to just above the floor and then mark the floor to establish the bottom plate's location directly below it. 
Snap a chalk line along the floor between the marks as a guide for the bottom plate's edge. 
Nail the plate with 3-inch nails staggered and spaced every 16 inches.
Attach each wall stud.
Use stud-framing clips to install each wall stud. 
Lift the stud into position and line it up on its mark, flush with the edges of the top and bottom plates. 
Check plumb using a carpenter's level, and nail the stud into place. 
(Alternatively, you can toenail each stud to both the top and bottom plate with 2 1/2-inch nails, but this is harder to do if you're inexperienced.)
Form the connections and corners. 
If the wall will turn a corner, frame it with two full-length studs that have blocks sandwiched in between.
On ceilings, use annular ring nails or drywall screws to fasten drywall panels to joists.
On walls, use drywall nails or screws to attach drywall panels ( Sheetrock ) to studs and top and bottom plates. 
Panel joints should be centered against ceiling joists or wall studs and staggered so they don't align with adjacent joints.
Place the fasteners at least 3/8 inch from panel edges.

Use drywall screws to fasten sheets to ceiling joists.
Before installing drywall panels, mark wall-stud locations on the floor and ceiling so you can find their locations easily after the panels are in place.
HomeTips Tip: Take photographs of walls before installing drywall so you can easily locate pipes and wires after walls are covered.
Place the fasteners at least 3/8 inch from panel edges.
If you nail the panels, use a bell-faced or drywall hammer to dimple the drywall surface with the final blow on each nailhead. 
To attach drywall to a ceiling, position a pair of stepladders or set up sturdy sawhorses and planks to serve as a low scaffold. 
Start fastening near the center of each panel and then place a few fasteners at the edges until the panel can support its own weight. 
Continue until each panel is fully fastened.
For walls, begin at a corner. 
Push the panel tight against the ceiling and fasten to the studs. 
Install the rest of the upper panels and then the lower ones. 
Force the lower panels tight against the upper ones before fastening, using a pry bar or a block and flat board as a lever. 
Make cutouts for receptacle and switch boxes using a power jigsaw.
Follow our step-by-step guide to bricklaying, from mixing mortar to getting a good-quality finish
Before you begin your project, you'll need to figure out the number of bricks required. 
To get an accurate picture of the number required for the task in hand, however, you need to account for a 10mm mortar bed. 
So to come up with the correct calculations, input your brick size as 225mm x 102.5mm x 75mm for standard products.
Step 1 use the string line
After any necessary foundations have been prepared, lay out the bricks at both ends of your wall where the pillars will start. 
Using your string line, make a straight guideline at brick height between the two outside bricks
Step 2 mix the cement
Heap five shovels full of sand and one of cement on an old board. 
Turn shovel to mix to a consistent colour. 
Form a central hollow, pour in water and mix. 
Repeat for a smooth, creamy texture that's wet but not too loose
Step 3 lay the mortar bedStep 3:
Lay a 1-2cm mortar bed along the string line. 
Starting at one end, lay the first brick and tap slightly to 'bed in'. 
Repeat using string line as a guide
Step 4 build up the brick pillars
At the point where you want your pillars to start, place a brick side-on to the end of the wall. 
Step 5 lay half bricks
When building pillars, at certain courses you'll need to lay half-bricks. 
To make a cut, place the brick on its side, locate the bolster at the split point and strike the head firmly with a club hammer. 
It should split cleanly first time
Always build at least a course higher on the pillars. 
Move the string line up as you build, bedding it into the mortar on the pillars. 
For a stretcher bond, the end of each brick should be over the centre of the one beneath
Step 8 Add a coping stone
Step 9 Add a soldier course
Turn your bricks vertically lengthways and lay along the full length. 
Use a second, higher string line to keep a uniform finish
Step 10 finish the mortar
To finish the beds, use the rounded edge of a brick jointer to scrape mortar into the joints. 
Start with the horizonal lines and follow with the vertical  " it's easier to remove any excess mortar this way
Step 11 brush down the brick
Give the finished wall a gentle brush over and clean up any mortar that has fallen onto the floor before it dries. 
You can use water to wash cement away from the floor, but be sure to keep it away from your newly-built wall!
Empty the mix into a mortar tub or wheelbarrow and form a depression in the middle of the mix.
Measure the recommended water amount  (each 80-pound bag of concrete mix will require about 3 quarts of water).
Pour approximately 2/3 of the water into the depression. 
If using liquid cement color, add to the mixing water.
Work the mix with a hoe, gradually adding water, until the mix reaches a uniform, workable consistency. 
If you're using portland cement, sand, and gravel the rule of thumb is to mix 1 shovel of cement with 2 shovels of sand and 3 shovels of gravel. 
Put these 6 total shovel fulls into a wheelbarrow or the electric mixer before you start adding water.
When you add more dry material keep these 1:2:3 ratios of cement, sand, and gravel the same for a consistent mix.
You just need to add the correct amount of water for a workable mix. 
STEP 1. Shovel the proper ratio of dry mix, or empty the quikcrete bag, into the wheelbarrow or electric mixer.
STEP 2. Start adding water, a little at a time, turn the dry material over and over while mixing it with the water.
STEP 3. Completely wet all the material, mix for a couple of minutes until you reach a clay consistency.
STEP 4. If a clay like consistency is too dry for your project, add a little more water, mix some more until you reach a pancake batter like consistency. 
STEP 5. If the mix gets to loose or water-like, just add a little more dry material to stiffen it up.
