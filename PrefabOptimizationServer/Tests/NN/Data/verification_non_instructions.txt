Carpet tiles are one of the most cost-effective ways to change your flooring, and also one of the easiest to put in place. 
Here's what you need to know.
At first glance, carpet tiles look like a cheap substitute for conventional carpet, and that is one of the roles they play. However, they do have advantages aside from relatively low costs (a basic 50cm by 50cm tile costs around $5.25).
Compared to carpet, they are much easier to install — you can do a simple room in a couple of hours — and don't require anything much in the way of specialised tools.
Because each square of tile is individual, you can easily create geometrical patterns if you so desire. 
It's also easy to replace an individual tile that has become worn or stained, eliminating the hassle of replacing larger areas of carpeting. 
Because of this, carpet tiles are often used in high-traffic areas such as hallways.
The obvious first steps are to measure the room so you can work out how many tiles you need. 
A typical tile is 50 centimetres by 50 centimetres, which means you need four for each square metre. 
If your room measures 2 metres by 4 metres, that's a total of 8 square metres, which means you'll need 32 tiles. 
If there's any complex cutting involved (to deal with gas heaters, door frames or other nuisances), you may want to grab a couple of spares to cover for mistakes. 
If they're not self-adhesive, you'll want some means of adhesion as well (discussed below).
Preparing your surface
As with most DIY jobs, the first job is preparing your surface. 
Whatever prep you do, the aim is to end up with a smooth, clean surface you can place the tiles on.
In this case, lifting up the carpet, removing the underlay and the staples that held it in place, and then getting rid of the tacked frame used to hold the carpet in place was considerably more work than any other part of the process. 
I didn't need to remove the paint stains on the underlying wooden floor, but I did have to ensure no staples or nails were in place.
Laying out your tiles
This is especially important if you're mixing different tiles to create a pattern.
That means that any cut or uneven tiles will appear at the edge of the room and create a symmetrical effect.
That won't always be the best approach, however. 
The example corridor pictured here was just under a metre wide, so it was less work (and more likely to look neat) by starting in one corner and working out. 
Unless your room has precise dimensions, you'll end up having to cut some tiles to fit. 
Fixing your tiles
Basic tiles generally don't have any built-in method of attachment; you can fix them using either glue or double-sided carpet tape. 
The picture at the top shows a fairly sloppy application of the latter. 
(You need approximately two metres for each 50cm by 50cm tile.)
More expensive tiles may be self-adhesive; in that case, remove the paper and stick in place.
If you've placed the tiles carefully, they will actually hold in place pretty well without being fixed in place. 
However, it's still a good idea to use some form of fixing to prevent someone unexpectedly tripping on them.
Lifehacker's weekly Reno 101 column covers the basics of renovation and DIY.
One of the best things about Heuga tiles is that they are easy to buy, easy to take home and easy to fit. 
Carpet tiles
Preparation
Conditioning of Materials
We recommend that all Heuga tiles should be unpacked and allowed to acclimatise for at least 24 hours at room temperature before laying.
Subfloors
The subfloor must be firm, level, dry and cleared of all debris. 
See Figure 1.
If tiles are to be laid at ground or below ground level, and there is any sign of dampness, then it is essential to seal the floor before fitting Heuga tiles. 
Floor sealants are available from most DIY stores. 
Woodblock floors in particular must be completely dry since any trapped moisture may cause the wood to expand and lift.
Heuga tiles can be laid over a variety of surfaces such as stone, ceramic, hardwood or vinyl floors. 
They cannot be laid over soft surfaces such as existing carpet, underlay or cork tiles.
Planning
Tools
Stanley knife, chalk line, tape measure and straight edge.
TacTiles is also advisable for the anchor rows and perimeter cuts.
Pile Direction
The underside of all Heuga tiles carries arrows to denote pile direction.
This laying direction is called "monolithic". 
In all cases please check the instructions printed on the packaging. 
Measurement
See Figure 2. 
This centre point will be the approximate starting point for the installation.
See Figure 3.
Method of Fixing
Heuga tiles are designed for free-lay installation for areas less than 30 m2. 
However along the anchor rows and for all perimeter cuts we would recommend the use of tackifier adhesive or approved acrylic double-sided tape.
The anchor rows are determined by the position of the chalk lines.
Installation
Method
See Figure 4. 
These anchor rows should be held using tackifier or approved acrylic double-sided tape - see above.
At the perimeter tiles may need to be cut. 
See Figure 5.
Perimeter tiles should be held using tackifier or approved acrylic double-sided tape - see above.
Alignment
Once the anchor rows are in place you can begin to fill in each of the four quadrants that you've created. 
See Figure 6. 
As you do so feel free to use double-sided tape or tackifier adhesive if you feel this is appropriate.
As tiles are butted against each other take care to check the joints with your fingers to ensure they are properly aligned.
Tightness
Loose joints will result in movement and poor floor performance. 
See Figure 7.
Rug installation instructions
Installing your Heuga rug is easy. 
Just follow the 5 simple steps below and your rug will be ready in no time.
1. Sub-floor
A Heuga rug can be laid over any smooth, hard floor like parquet, laminate and stone.
Ensure the surface is clean, level and dry.
2. Preparation
We recommend that all carpet tiles will be removed from the box and allowed to acclimatise for 24 hours to room temperature.
In the box you will find TacTiles connectors to attach the tiles together. 
The sticky side of the TacTiles faces up on the back of the carpet tile so they don't leave marks on the floor.
The arrows on the back of each carpet tile indicate the direction of the pile. 
3. Cutting
You could use your knife to draw an arrow on the back of the tile for example.
Please note: carpet tiles can have minimal variations in size from the standard size of 50 cm. 
Therefore we recommend you measure the tiles carefully before cutting.
4. Installation
One TacTile sticks the corners of four tiles together or the edges of two tiles for the border tiles. 
Each Tactile is notched so you know exactly where to line up the next tile.
5. Finishing
You can change the design when you want: TacTiles allow you to easily replace tiles. 
You can even lift your rug and move it to another location as the TacTiles ensure it stays together.
Maintaining your Heuga rug is easy.
Regularly vacuuming deals with every day dust and dirt. 
Spills should be treated immediately. 
If permanently damaged, replace the tile with a new one.
The original rumpus room in Handyman deputy editor Frank Gardner's home had been revamped in the mid-90s when his children were still teenagers.
"Back then we needed a living area that would withstand two kids,a dog and a cat," says Frank.
Over the years the room became less a family area and more a storage space for unused bits and pieces.
"the idea for a makeover developed as things went wrong," says Frank.
A leaking water heater that created a welcoming environment for termites was the first catalyst. 
This led to the removal of timber framework, leaving unsightly gaps in the original floor tiles.
Next, the adjacent bathroom underwent a major modernisation complete with new tiling. 
"the new tiles made the original area look very shabby, so it was time to finish the job," says Frank.
Frank's five-year-old grandkids visit on a regular basis so the rumpus room needed to be kid-friendly.
The old apricot tiles were broken and cold underfoot, so needed to be replaced. 
Lots of wear and tear was certain, so carpet tiles were chosen.
"With carpet tiles you can always move any damaged ones to a less noticeable area," says Frank.
Many of the spring-loaded clips for the downlights had broken, allowing them to work loose and pose a hazard, so new recessed downlights featuring energy-saving CFLs were installed.
The makeover plan 
"We needed to make the room warm, light and neutral without spending too much money," says Frank.
The floors, walls and lighting all needed attention. 
To save time and money, Frank patched the holes in the floor instead of pulling up all the tiles.
When the repairs were finished the room was repainted in a neutral palette, with the promise of tasty refreshments luring friends and family to lend a hand.
Says Frank, "After two coats of Dulux White Pepper on the walls and gloss acrylic in the same colour on  the timber trim the room appears much lighter. 
We also freshened up with two coats of Ceiling White."
Frank chose 1000mm square polypropylene carpet tiles, about $24 each, from Bunnings, as they can be cut using a utility knife and laid DIY. 
"We only messed up one tile while cutting because we forgot to check the laying arrow on the back," he says.
To finish, an electrician was hired to fit new low-wattage downlights then the room was furnished with comfy seating, bookshelves and custom-made low line cabinetry.
"the Tassie oak cabinets were made by my brother-in-law and give the room a classy look," Frank says.

Step 6. 
While laying traditional carpet is a complicated process best undertaken by a professional, almost anyone can lay carpet tiles. 
They are light and easy to handle, stick to the subfloor without buckling or wrinkling, and are very easy to cut. 
They also have advantages beyond installation. 
If a section of carpet gets worn, damaged or stained, you can pull up the affected tiles and lay a few new ones without redoing your whole floor.

How an Interior Wall Is Built
In Short:
An interior wall is typically built from 2-by-4 or 2-by-6 wall studs and framing, covered with panels of gypsum drywall that are nailed or screwed to the framing members.
In Depth:
Many remodeling projects involve building or relocating one or more interior walls. 
Building a nonbearing interior wall is relatively easy, requiring just basic carpentry skills and tools.
Depending on the nature of your existing floor, walls, and ceiling, you may have to peel away some surface materials to provide for secure attachment at the top, bottom, and ends of the new wall. 
If the new wall won't butt into studs at the connecting wall or fall directly beneath a ceiling joist, you must install nailing blocks between the framing pieces.
A typical interior wall has a skeleton of vertical 2-by-4 studs that stand between horizontal 2-by-4 base and top plates. 
(However, if a wall will contain extensive plumbing, it should be built from 2-by-6 studs and plates.)
The framework is typically covered with gypsum wallboard or lath and plaster; in a bathroom, with water-resistant  green  wallboard and tile backerboard and tile.
Following are the steps for framing a wall.

Special drywall lifts, available through tool rental supplies, make raising and supporting ceiling panels a much easier job.
Using a screw gun or drill driver to attach panels is easiest, particularly for ceilings. 
Most codes call for spacing fasteners every 8 inches along panel ends, edges, and intermediate supports.

Most codes call for spacing fasteners every 8 inches along panel ends, edges, and intermediate supports. 
This creates a small divot that you will subsequently fill with drywall compound.
Then you and a helper can hold each end of a panel in place against the ceiling joists.

Bricklaying is considered one of the more approachable construction skills, and many self builders are understandably keen to give it a go. 
But this isn't a tasked to be taken on lightly, especially if you're building structural walls. 
The easiest route to great results is enlisting a good brickie. 
Using an experienced tradesman may be cost-effective, too, as it's likely to speed up the build and minimise mistakes.
If you do want to tackle an involved bricklaying project, it makes sense to practice first. 
Even the most confident DIYer will need to get to grips with the process first. 
Trying your hand at building a garden wall is a great place to start. 
You'll learn everything from setting out the footprint and maintaining level and square to mixing the mortar, bedding the bricks and finishing joints neatly.
Standard types are 215mm x 102.5mm x 65mm. 
Brick wall project guide:
Step 1:
Step 2:
'Butter up' one end of the next brick with mortar and abut it to the first. 
Step 4:
As you build up the wall, each consecutive course of pillar bricks must be laid in the opposite direction
Step 5:
Step 6 stretcher bond brickwork
Step 6:
Step 7 10mm mortar jointsStep 7:
Vertical mortar joints should be 10mm thick. 
With standard bricks there should be 75mm from the top of one to the top of that beneath. 
If your bricks soak up moisture fast, you may want to 'joint up' (step 10) as you go
Step 8:
When you reach the top of the pillars, you may want to add a coping stone to finish. 
Alternatively, you could create a pleasant effect at less cost by bedding bricks into the mortar on their sides
Step 9:
Adding a 'soldier course' is an attractive option to top the main part of a garden wall.

Properly mixed concrete should look like thick oatmeal and should hold its shape when it is squeezed in a gloved hand.
NOTE: the more water that is added to the mix the weaker it becomes; adding one extra quart of water per 80 lb bag can reduce the strength of the concrete by up to 40%.
HOW TO MIX CONCRETE
You can use this guide on how to mix concrete by hand for a pre-mixed bag like quikcrete or if you're using a bag of cement, sand, gravel, and water.
The instructions are very similar, the only difference being with the pre-mixed bag the dry materials are already combined.
THINGS YOU'LL NEED:
1. Wheelbarrow
2. Water/Hose
3. Bags of Portland Cement
4. Gloves/Safety glasses
5. Shovel and/or Hoe
6. Sand and Gravel
7. Pre-mixed bags Quikcrete (optional)
8. Electric mixer (optional)

Not too wet or you'll weaken the mix.
Keeping the ratios of cement, sand, gravel, (1:2:3) and water the same throughout the project will insure consistency until you complete your job.
A 5 ft. x 5 ft. square pad equals 25 square feet. 
If this pad is 4 inches thick it will take 15 of the 80 lb bags of pre-mixed quikcrete.
If you double the square feet to 50 which is 10 ft x 5 ft x 4 inches thick that will take 30 bags of quikcrete in the 80 lb bags.
A bag of 80 lb quikcrete sells for about $3.35 US dollars in Maine.
A bag of 94 lb portland cement sells for $8.63 US dollars in Maine.
A bag of 50 lb sand sells for $2.34 US dollars in Maine.
Learning how to mix concrete by hand is simple but it is hard work.
If your project is any larger than 50 square feet then it might be worth calling a Ready-mix concrete company and have them deliver the concrete in a concrete truck. 
The concrete will come all mixed and all you have to do is place it inside your forms.

One yard of concrete will do 80 square feet (8 x 10) 4 inches thick and will cost about $100.00 dollars US from a ready-mix plant. 
They may charge a small load charge, be sure to ask to make sure it's cost effective to go this way. The same size pad would take 46 pre-mixed 80 pound bags of Quikrete or Sakrete.  
That's a lot of mixing by hand.
We usually buy pre-mixed bags of concrete when we mix concrete by hand. 
We also use an electric drill with a mixing paddle, it's much easier and faster if you have these tools available.
