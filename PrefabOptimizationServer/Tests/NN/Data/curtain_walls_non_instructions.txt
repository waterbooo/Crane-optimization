GENERAL INSTALLATION NOTES
If forklifts are used, be especially careful about striking the boxes when lifting or moving.
Wet packagingmaterials will discolor and may stain aluminum finishes and paints.
Remember, if the construction is not per the construction documents, it is your responsibility to notify the general contractor in writing.
Installation instructions are of a general nature and may not address every condition you will encounter.
The shop drawings were prepared specifically for the project.
Any material substitutions must be of equal or greater quality.
System-to-structure fasteners are not supplied by Aluflam.
Fasteners called out on shop drawings are to indicate minimum sizes.
Aluflam product installation is frequently completed before drywall, flooring and other products.
Cutting tolerances are ± 1/32”, unless otherwise specified.
Concrete, mortar, plaster, muriatic acid and other alkaline and acid based construction and cleaning materials may be very harmful to framefinishes and should be removed with water and mild soap immediately or permanent damage or staining of the finishes may occur.
A spot test is recommended before any cleaning agent is used, and abrasive type cleaners must never be used.
Frames are never to be used as ladders, step stools, scaffolds or scaffold supports.
Glass and glazing building codes governing the design and use of products vary widely.
Aluflam North America, LLC does not control the selection of the products, product configurations, operating hardware and function, or glazing materials, and Aluflam assumes no responsibility for these design considerations.
It is the responsibility of the design professional, owner, architect, specifier, general contractor, and the installer to make these selections in strict accordance with all applicable codes.
INSTALLATION
STEP 1
At this point, the frame joints are unprotected.
STEP 2
STEP 3
MULTIPLE FRAMES
Strips of wood are very suitable for this purpose.
“T” brackets are factory installed to the vertical mullions in accordance with shop drawings.
NOTE:
STEP 4
INSTALLATION OF FRAME
STEP 5
See Figure 7.
See Figure 8.
STEP 6
GLAZING
The Swissflam and Contraflam glass products that are used in Aluflam frame systems are heavy and fragile.
NOTE – THE STAINLESS STEEL GLASS CLIPS ARE KEY TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ALUFLAM CURTAINWALL SYSTEM AND MUST BE INSTALLED. 
NOTE – CENTER THE PRESSURE PLATES SO THE GASKET OVERLAP THE STAINLESS GLASS CLIPS ON BOTH SIDES. FAILURE TO DO SO CAN RESULT IN LEAKAGE.

These installation instructions are generic in nature but specific to the PRL curtain wall systems.
They are specific to all of PRL’s curtain-walls including the PLCW-600, PLCW-700 and PLCW-1000.
The shop drawings will take precedence over these instructions as they are project specific.
You may refer to PRL’s test reports for further familiarity with construction details of the curtain walls.
We sell only to bona fide professional glazing contractors and we expect that you employ seasoned journeymen who have apprenticed and been trained in all aspects of fenestration construction and assembly.
We expect that you are familiar with, and have installed products of same and similar type.
You should be aware of local building codes and practices and be sure to comply with them.
PRL has no ability to ensure you are complying and practicing in accordance with them and assumes no responsibility for your compliance.
These installation and assembly instructions refer you to areas where caulking seals are required.
You will clean using sealant manufactures recommended solvents.
You will use any adhesion primers or adhesion promoters that the sealant supplier recommends to you.
These instructions show one of many acceptable steps to fabricate and install the curtain wall system.
We recommend a heavy coat of bituminous paint.
We recommend that after 5% of the project has been glazed and completed a water test be performed in accordance with AAMA-501.2.
We recommend this test be repeated every time an additional 10% has been completed until the project is 100% complete.
PRL’s products are constantly being refined, improved and expanded.

CURTAIN WALL AND ENTRANCE SYSTEMS
These instructions cover typical product application, fabrication, installation and standard conditions and are general in nature. 
They provide useful guidelines, but the final shop drawings may include additional details specific to the project. 
Any conflict or discrepancies must be clarified prior to execution.
Materials stored at the job site must be kept in a safe place protected from possible damage by other trades.
Stack with adequate separation so materials will not rub together and store off the ground. 
Cardboard or paper wrapped materials must be kept dry. Check arriving materials for quantity and keep a record of where various materials are stored.
Results will be unsightly and may be structurally unsound. 
Advise general contractor and other trades accordingly.
Fasteners attaching framing to building structure are typically not provided by Tubelite.
Sealant selection is the responsibility of the erector, installer and/or glazing contractor and must be approved by the sealant manufacturer with regard to application and compatibility for its intended use. 
Recommend sealant manufacturer perform adhesion “pull test” at “wet” glazing for quality assurance.
Tubelite will not accept responsibility for improper drainage as a result of clogged gutters and weep holes.
This product requires clearances at the head, sill and jambs to allow for thermal expansion and contraction as well as construction tolerances. 
Joints smaller than 1/4” may be subject to failure. 
All framing members, entrances and other materials are to be installed plumb, level and true with regard to established bench marks, column center lines or other working points established by the general contractor and checked by the erector, installer and/or glazing contractor.
Over tightening any fastener may cause stripping or fastener failure. 
Tubelite recommends the use of drill motors with clutches engaged to provide satisfactory tightening of the screw while preventing over torque. 
The use of impact drill motors is not recommended due to the absence of a clutch device.
