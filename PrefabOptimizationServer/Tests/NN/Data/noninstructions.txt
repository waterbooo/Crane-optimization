That will give you the center of the tile. 
These four lines will create a cross hair at the center of the room.

The last step is to cut the carpet squares to fit at the wall. 
Things to think about
How many tiles you need can be worked out by simply dividing the floor area in square metres by the pack size.
Length of room x width of room = number of square metres.
Square metres ÷ pack coverage = how much you need (add 10% for cutting waste).
Concrete floors can be tiled on direct as long as they are flat, sound, level, clean and dry. 
The floor must contain an integral damp proof membrane – standard in modern homes, but not always in older properties.
Floorboards must be covered with thin ply or flooring grade hardboard (unless otherwise directed) to provide a sound, flat surface for applying tiles. 
Ply is easily cut with a hand saw, or jigsaw, cut hardboard with a retractable knife. 
Stagger joins of adjacent sheets.
There are alternatives to the grid design, here. 
You can stagger joins, or consider going diagonally across the room for a diamond-effect pattern. 
Whichever you choose, tiles are laid in the same way; just adjust the start position accordingly.
The starting point is important to establish a balanced design that allows for manageable cuts. 
If possible, make sure that you don't have to cut small slivers on any wall edge of the design.
A starting point square to one wall is important. 
If you dry lay a row of tiles close to one wall, you can then measure across to the opposite wall to check what size of cut tiles this position will leave. 
You can then adjust the dry laid row until a good balance is achieved. 
Check at each end of the row, as this will help to square up your starting position relative to the walls.
Most carpet tiles don't require adhesive and are laid dry. You can use double-sided tape in the first row, but, then, unless guides specify, lay dry. Some tiles have adhesive tabs, so replacing a damaged one is easy: simply lift out the old one and fit in the new one.
Cork tiles are normally self-adhesive with a finished surface, so laying instructions are as shown here.
Sometimes they require a separate adhesive and may need to be sealed after laying. 
Wooden parquet tiles are also laid in a similar fashion as shown in this guide. 
Like cork tiles, they may require a sealer once laid.
Accuracy is important for a neat finish up to the skirting.
A junior hacksaw is ideal for cutting down either wooden or metal thresholds.
The threshold can be screwed down. 
If particular screws have been provided, use them. 
You can also use grab adhesive to hold it in place.
You can also use spray adhesive to hold tiles in place. 
Make sure you use one recommended for the tiles. 
Also, wear a mask and keep the room ventilated.
The direction in which you lay the tiles will affect the pile pattern you achieve. 
1. Choosing the Right Carpet Tiles
Choosing the right carpet tiles
Carpet tiles are great for high traffic areas. 
You can replace individual tiles as they wear or stain. 
They come in a huge range of colours and textures, have natural sound absorbing properties and very soft underfoot.
Carpet tiles can be treated to protect against soiling and staining. 
This helps them look good and feel good for longer.
How many tiles will you need?
To work out how many tiles you need simply measure the width of the room by the length. 
For instance a 4m by 3m room has a 12 square metre floor.
Each pack will tell you how much floor the tiles will cover. 
Tiles from the same range may be slightly different in colour. 
To avoid this, buy all your tiles at the same time from the same batch number.
Some carpet tiles come with their own adhesive dots. 
If so, you won’t need double sided tape.
2. Preparation
Different floors need different preparation.
You can tile directly onto a flat concrete floor as long as it has been sealed with a suitable primer.
Wooden floorboards will need to be covered with 19mm plywood or hardboard to provide a sound, rigid surface for tiling. 
Whichever floor you choose, it has to be thoroughly clean and dry before you start tiling.
The position of the first tile always determines the end result.
Tiles look best when centred in the middle of the room with narrow cut tiles at the edge. 
You can find the centre of a room by running a line from corner to corner, both ways.
Laying carpet tiles
Most carpet tiles are not glued to the floor. 
They are dry laid, and held in place with double-sided tape on every third row.
Step 1
There are usually arrows on the back of the tiles which idicate which way to lay them.
Step 2
Step 3
Step 4
If you want extra security, you can use spray adhesive to hold the tiles in place. 
Make sure it’s one recommended for the tiles. 
Remember to wear a mask and keep the room well ventilated.

1. Measuring up
It's easy to work out how many tiles you'll need. 
Vinyl tiles vary in size but all Homebase carpet tiles are 50cm x 50cm - i.e. four tiles = 1m2.
2. Choosing the right tiles
Carpet tiles are ideal for bedrooms. 
Generally, vinyl and carpet tiles are all fine for living rooms, bathrooms and kitchens.
It's best not to put floor tiles in your conservatory - intense sunlight and temperature can make them fade and shrink.
3. Preparing the sub floor
You shouldn't use timber treated with wood preservatives as a sub-floor, even if it's overlaid with hardboard.
If you're laying tiles over a concrete sub-floor it must be smooth, absolutely dry and have an integral damp-proof membrane.
Remember, new concrete floors can take up to six months to dry. 
And they have to be completely dried out before you can lay new tiles.
Helpful hint...
You shouldn't lay vinyl tiles over underfloor heating as they can lift or warp. 
Carpet tiles are fine up to a maximum floor temperature of 28oC.
4. Getting the right adhesive
5. Planning and marking the room
You'll achieve the best look for your floor if the tiles are centred in the doorway.
Ideally you want the tiles around the edge of your room to be equal in width on both sides or ends - i.e. avoid narrow strips at the edges and in doorways. 
(Fig. 1 shows where the tiles should stop in a doorway.)
The tiles should finish in a slightly different place depending on whether the door opens into or out of the room.
Figure 1
Figure 2
Figure 3
Figure 4
6. Laying the tiles
This should create good straight lines.
If you're laying vinyl tiles, and the surfaces of adjacent tiles aren't level, you can usually even them out with a block of softwood and a hammer (fig. 6)
Figure 5
Figure 6
7. Cutting the border tiles
You can bend a vinyl tile to break it. 
Piece 'A' is now a perfectly fitting border tile.
Figure 7
Figure 8
8. Tackling tiling around pipes and architraves
It's actually easier to cut out a section at the bottom of the architrave itself. 
To fit vinyl or carpet tiles around pipes, you pierce a pipe-shaped hole in your tile that's slightly larger than the pipe itself.
Figure 9
Figure 10
9. Finishing around the doorways
You can get threshold strips to suit surfaces that meet at equal or differing heights.
10. Carpet pile direction
Arranging your tiles like this gives a checkerboard effect (fig. 11).
Arrows on the reverse of the tiles indicate the way to lay them.

Five simple steps for a professional finish
A printable version of our fitting guide is available here
Before you start laying carpet tiles there are a few basic tools you will need to complete the job. 
A tape measure, fixed blade utility knife, metal ruler and some double sided tape. 
For larger areas we recommend using carpet tile tackifier adhesive. 
This process is especially important during winter months. 
The tiles can arrive cold after being stored in our warehouse or left overnight at a transport depot. 
By laying straight into a centrally heated room expansion can cause the tiles to peak if not allowed sufficient time to come up to room temperature. 
Carpet tiles are easy enough to lay yourself and you can even custom design your floor by using coloured borders, making patterns or insetting shapes and letters.
The subfloor must be firm, clean and dry. 
The tiles will lay straight onto either a stone, concrete or wooden floor without the need for underlay. 
If the old carpet has been glued down then we recommend cutting into strips with a hook blade knife and for large areas hiring a carpet lifting tool to assist with removal. 
Image of subfloor preparation
Measuring the floor before fitting carpet tiles
On the back of each tile there are pile direction arrows. 
You can lay the arrows different ways to achieve shading effects either monolithic or quarter turn. 
We find dry laying a row both ways helps to complete this task. 
We advise against starting with a whole tile on one wall as you may be left with a small cut the other side.
It is an off white liquid similar to PVA glue and can be applied by either roller or brush (1 litre of adhesive is enough to lay 24 - 28 tiles with total coverage). 
It is important you wait for the tackifier to go from white to completely transparent before laying the carpet tiles otherwise permanent bonding can occur. 
This is a specially formulated low tack adhesive for use with carpet tiles providing a tacky film to the floor. 
In the future you can lift tiles for cleaning or replacement.
Applying carpet tile adhesive to floor
Laying carpet tiles
Clogged blades can be cleaned by using white spirit and a cloth. 
If you loose lay the tiles we recommend no more than 100 tiles be fitted per room. 
Job completed and tiles all fitted
Pile Direction
On the rear of each tile there are pile direction arrows. 
When fitting you have the option of laying the carpet tiles either quarter turn or the more traditional broadloom way called monolithic. 
Quarter turn can be achieved by laying the arrows at 90 degrees to each other. 
If you lay this way the pile is highlighted giving a subtle light and dark definition to the tiles. 
Monolithic is where the arrows all point the same direction and this helps to hide the edges of the tiles and gives more of a standard carpet effect (arrow diagrams are shown at top of the page). 
Laying directions do not affect the wear of the tile in any way but can help to create more of a contemporary look to the area.
Vacuuming carpet tiles and maintenance
Carpet Tile Care and Maintenance
Regular daily vacuuming is recommended to keep the appearance of your carpet tiles. 
Any spills should be lifted immediately with a damp cloth. 
Most stains can be removed by using an appropriate carpet cleaner however do not use bleach or petrol based products.
If the stain does not come out try moving to a less noticeable place.
We recommend replacing any damaged tiles with new ones so always make sure you keep a few spare in case of future accidents. 
By using either double sided tape or carpet tile tackifier adhesive on your floor prior to fitting will help to prolong the life of your carpet tiles. 
Laying Carpet Tiles
One of the great advantages of using carpet tiles is the ease with which you can cut and lay them yourself - this means you can save on expensive fitting costs generally associated with other types of floor covering.
You can also use contrasting or co-ordinating colours to build your own custom design or to highlight specific areas, such as walkways.
Some important things to remember before you start are:
-Carpet Tiles Fitting Guide
Carpet Tiles - Broadloom or Chequerboard Fitting Options
Broadloom Chequerboard
Proper tools are key to a professional finish.
The tools you will need are a sharp utility knife, metal ruler or straight edge, chalk line, double-sided carpet tape or tackifier adhesive (F. Ball F41).
Carpet tiles must be stored in the laying area for a minimum of 24 hours at the same temperature and humidity that will apply when the tiles are laid. 
This should be at least 18º C (65º F). 
Floor surfaces should be clean, dry and free from dust and debris. 
All traces of old floor coverings should be completely removed prior to fitting. 
Where floors are particularly uneven a self levelling floor screed should be laid and allowed to fully dry, prior to installation taking place. 
Setting Out
Carpet Tiles Fitting Diagram
General Maintenance
Appropriate care and maintenance is essential to appearance retention and longevity of the carpet tiles.
Regular daily vacuuming is recommended. 
Spillages should be cleaned immediately with a damp cloth before allowing to dry. 
Stains can be removed by using a good quality purpose made carpet cleaner carefully following the manufacturer's instructions. 
Traffic paths may be avoided by periodically interchanging the tiles. 
Damaged tiles can be lifted and moved to a less noticeable area or simply replaced. 
Full maintenance instructions are available upon request.

About modular carpet
If you think installing new carpet is time consuming and complicated, think again. 
Modular carpet, aka carpet squares, is one of the easiest floor coverings to install. 
You simply lay the squares on the floor; adhesive strips and the carpet's heavy backing hold them in place.
You can finish most rooms in a day, if not an afternoon. 
And you can use it anywhere. 
You can add whimsy to a kids' playroom or create an elegant look in a formal dining room.
Or, if you don't need wall-to-wall carpet, these squares make great area rugs. 
Cleaning, replacing or swapping squares is easy too. 
They just pull right up—even after they're adhered. 
You can clean off stained squares in the sink or replace them. 
Is that kid-friendly, or what?
Modular carpet is slightly more expensive than most conventional carpets, but a carpet pad isn't required and you save by installing it yourself.
In this article, we'll show you how to install the carpet and cut it to fit around obstacles such as doorjambs. 
Installation is nearly goof proof — you can easily pull up misaligned squares and reposition them. 
And you won't need any specialty tools. 
A tape measure and chalk line to snap your baselines, and a carpenter's square and utility knife to cut the squares will get the job done.

With practically unlimited carpet options, the hardest part may be choosing a design. 
You'll have to select the brand you want before you start, since the brands have different sizes of squares. 
They call attention to any wall not perfectly square. 
Your final drawing will tell you how many squares of each color you'll need.
Back to Top 1
You can lay carpet squares directly over concrete, plywood and OSB or particleboard subfloors, as well as over vinyl, tile, laminate and some hardwood finished floors. 
One caution: The backing may eventually discolor some wood floors. 
If you later decide to remove the carpet, you'll have to refinish the wood. 
If the moisture content is too high, you can always seal the concrete, then install the carpet. 
Any wood subfloor or existing floor has to be solid, dry and securely fastened. 
This is also an ideal time to find and fix any floor squeaks.

Extra strips come in the box. 
You only have to adhere the baseline rows and the squares on both sides of the baselines and along the perimeter of the room. 
The others stay put thanks to their heavy backing. 
(No, they don't pop out when you're vacuuming!)
A utility knife works OK for cutting the squares, but we prefer a carpet knife because it's a bit more accurate. 
The backing allows for a crisp cut that won't unravel.

Cutting carpet to fit around outside corners, archway walls and doorjambs is the most challenging part of the job. 
It's best to slightly undercut the mark, then fine-tune as needed for a tight fit. 
This same method works for marking and notching squares to fit around corners.
It'll probably take several tries before you get a good fit. 
Since the carpet won't unravel, threshold strips aren't required. 
Instead, you can simply butt against the flooring in the next room or the existing threshold (Photo 11).
It's inevitable that something will eventually spill on the floor, but carpet squares are easy to clean.

How to clean carpet in 7 easy steps
From basements to baby rooms, carpet tiles will complete your space. 
(Dante Carpet Tile Lark Collection – Dark Brown Stripe)
Carpet tiles are colorful, versatile, and easy to install, making them the perfect comfort flooring option for homeowners and renters interested in do-it-yourself projects. 
What’s more, carpet tiles can be placed over existing floors, eliminating the time and effort needed to remove old flooring and flooring adhesive.
While laying carpet tile is a simple process, carefully taking things step-by-step will help ensure the tiles lay evenly and correctly, and last longer. 
That being said, here are the 7 key steps you should follow if you choose to install carpet tiles in your own home or rental.
Tools & Materials
measuring tape
Carpenter’s square
chalk line
utility knife with a heavy-duty blade
adhesive (either peel-and-stick Rightbac tape or dri-tac glue)
u-notch trowel for applying adhesive
Having control over the carpet pattern is one of the many benefits of using modular tiles. 
For instance, each square could feature the same color, or you could mix and match several to create a customized look. 
As far as layouts go, you could choose one of these popular options (the direction each carpet tile faces is based on the arrow on back of the tile, which indicates pile direction):
Monolithic/Broadloom: Point all tiles in the same direction
Quarter Turn/ Checker Board: Turn tiles 90 degrees from one another
Ashlar: Point all tiles in the same direction; offset tiles by half a tile along the length
Brick: Point all tiles in the same direction; offset tiles by half a tile along the width
Unlike rolled carpet installation, carpet tile installation doesn’t require you to totally remove your furniture from the room – just move items as needed. 
Whether you’re installing over an existing floor made from linoleum, hardwood, or concrete, or on top of a plywood subfloor, you need to inspect the surface to ensure it’s ready for installation. 
It’s important to let the surface fully dry before installation because any moisture or debris left beneath the tiles can cause wear or promote the growth of mold and mildew. 
After these steps, the subfloor will be ready for tile installation.
This is where your tools will come in handy, so be sure to have them ready.
This is where having a friend will be helpful. 
He or she can drag the line to the other wall and you can snap the string to leave the chalk mark. 
This will create a perfectly centered plus sign in your space.
For equal distribution around the room’s edges, you’ll want to make sure that the tiles that touch the wall are no less than half a tile wide. 
You might need to adjust your chalk lines.
It may help to score a line before cutting all the way through. 
Any smaller, and the pieces are too difficult to secure to the floor. 
This is why laying tiles before sticking them to the ground is important.
Peel-and-stick carpet tiles have adhesive on the back of the tiles. 
When it comes to glue, however, you’ll need the adhesive and your u-notch trowel. 
As you can see, installing modular carpet tiles is easy and gives you plenty of freedom in terms of design.

Whether doing it for aesthetic reasons or to help warm up a cold room, carpeting concrete floors is something most people can do in a day or two. 
Why pay someone else to do it? 
By learning to prep the room for carpeting and using the right materials, you'll ensure that the job will go quickly and smoothly.

Typically, you'll be asked some basic questions about the room and your intended use for the room. 
These questions are designed to help you pick the most appropriate carpet, and are good questions to ask yourself anyway. 
It helps to give some thought beforehand so you don't have to make a hasty decision.
[1] A dealer may ask:
Will there be heavy or light traffic in the room?
Do you have kids or pets?
Is there direct access from outside?
How large is the room?
Dealers will also typically try to sell you on Stainmaster, Teflon, and Anti-Static technology at various levels of expense to you.

Some carpet is backed with jute, which is too absorbent to use on concrete. 
A chemical-resistant fiber that will stand up to aggressive cleaning solutions like bleach, this might not be the softest or most attractive carpet, but it will last.[2]

Any drainage issues in the room you're planning to carpet need to be addressed before carpeting. 
Ignoring the problem now could result in a costly and expensive project down the road, especially if you end up with harmful mold and end up having to tear out the carpet and repeat all your hard work.

For about 48 hours prior to and after installation, the temperature should stay between 65°F and 95°F (18°C and 35°C) and humidity between 10% and 65%. 
By observing these conditions, your carpet installation should go smoothly.

Carpeting is a chemical soup full of solvents.
You might have to sand down the bottom of the doors and trim door jams to ensure smooth closing after the carpet installation.
You should do this a week or more prior to carpet installation day to allow plenty of time for the waterproofing to be done.
You can download your copy of the installation guide or read on for more details.
before you fit your carpet
There’s a time and a place for everything, and fitting carpet is no exception. 
According to British Standards Code of Practice – BS CP 102, BS 5325 and supplementary specifications, your working area must be clean, fully enclosed, weather-tight and heated to 18°C (64.5°F) for 72 hours before fitting any floor coverings. 
A concrete protimeter should give a maximum moisture reading of 5.5%, and hygrometer tests should show a maximum relative humidity of 75%. 
If you don’t get these readings, primers, sealers and adhesives may take longer to dry – or not dry properly at all. 
The excess moisture could mean you need to install a suitable damp proof membrane.
If it’s an uneven or worn wooden floor, replace or patch level any floorboards as necessary, then cover with flooring grade hardboard (rough side up) or plywood. 
Dampness from the ground, and loose, uneven or unsound blocks can cause problems. 
If you have any doubts about these issues, you’ll need to replace the blocks – or better still, remove them and repair the base. 
Some people try to create a level surface with fabricated underlays, but hammering staples or nails into the blocks often fractures them, so we don’t recommend this.
All kinds of carpet, vinyl and other soft floor coverings are totally unsuitable surfaces for laying new carpet or carpet tiles. 
It may simply be impossible to achieve the conditions we’ve described so far – or there may be something unusual about the site where you need to fit carpet. 
If so, it’s really important you talk to us before you go ahead. 
We’ll give you any advice we can, but we can’t take responsibility for any problems you may have where the conditions are not ideal.
carpet tiles
First, a few things to check
In busy areas, such as around photocopiers and coffee machines, or where there are castor chairs or filing cabinets, you’ll need to use a suitable release or permanent bond adhesive.
In areas where spillages may occur, it’s best to use burmatex barrier tiles.
This will then fit the required space exactly.

GENERAL INSTALLATION NOTES
If forklifts are used, be especially careful about striking the boxes when lifting or moving.
Wet packagingmaterials will discolor and may stain aluminum finishes and paints.
Remember, if the construction is not per the construction documents, it is your responsibility to notify the general contractor in writing.
Installation instructions are of a general nature and may not address every condition you will encounter.
The shop drawings were prepared specifically for the project.
Any material substitutions must be of equal or greater quality.
System-to-structure fasteners are not supplied by Aluflam.
Fasteners called out on shop drawings are to indicate minimum sizes.
Aluflam product installation is frequently completed before drywall, flooring and other products.
Cutting tolerances are ± 1/32”, unless otherwise specified.
Concrete, mortar, plaster, muriatic acid and other alkaline and acid based construction and cleaning materials may be very harmful to framefinishes and should be removed with water and mild soap immediately or permanent damage or staining of the finishes may occur.
A spot test is recommended before any cleaning agent is used, and abrasive type cleaners must never be used.
Frames are never to be used as ladders, step stools, scaffolds or scaffold supports.
Glass and glazing building codes governing the design and use of products vary widely.
Aluflam North America, LLC does not control the selection of the products, product configurations, operating hardware and function, or glazing materials, and Aluflam assumes no responsibility for these design considerations.
It is the responsibility of the design professional, owner, architect, specifier, general contractor, and the installer to make these selections in strict accordance with all applicable codes.

These installation instructions are generic in nature but specific to the PRL curtain wall systems.
They are specific to all of PRL’s curtain-walls including the PLCW-600, PLCW-700 and PLCW-1000.
The shop drawings will take precedence over these instructions as they are project specific.
You may refer to PRL’s test reports for further familiarity with construction details of the curtain walls.
We sell only to bona fide professional glazing contractors and we expect that you employ seasoned journeymen who have apprenticed and been trained in all aspects of fenestration construction and assembly.
We expect that you are familiar with, and have installed products of same and similar type.
You should be aware of local building codes and practices and be sure to comply with them.
PRL has no ability to ensure you are complying and practicing in accordance with them and assumes no responsibility for your compliance.
These installation and assembly instructions refer you to areas where caulking seals are required.
You will clean using sealant manufactures recommended solvents.
You will use any adhesion primers or adhesion promoters that the sealant supplier recommends to you.
These instructions show one of many acceptable steps to fabricate and install the curtain wall system.
We recommend a heavy coat of bituminous paint.
We recommend that after 5% of the project has been glazed and completed a water test be performed in accordance with AAMA-501.2.
We recommend this test be repeated every time an additional 10% has been completed until the project is 100% complete.
PRL’s products are constantly being refined, improved and expanded.

CURTAIN WALL AND ENTRANCE SYSTEMS
These instructions cover typical product application, fabrication, installation and standard conditions and are general in nature. 
They provide useful guidelines, but the final shop drawings may include additional details specific to the project. 
Any conflict or discrepancies must be clarified prior to execution.
Materials stored at the job site must be kept in a safe place protected from possible damage by other trades.
Stack with adequate separation so materials will not rub together and store off the ground. 
Cardboard or paper wrapped materials must be kept dry. Check arriving materials for quantity and keep a record of where various materials are stored.
Results will be unsightly and may be structurally unsound. 
Advise general contractor and other trades accordingly.
Fasteners attaching framing to building structure are typically not provided by Tubelite.
Sealant selection is the responsibility of the erector, installer and/or glazing contractor and must be approved by the sealant manufacturer with regard to application and compatibility for its intended use. 
Recommend sealant manufacturer perform adhesion “pull test” at “wet” glazing for quality assurance.
Tubelite will not accept responsibility for improper drainage as a result of clogged gutters and weep holes.
This product requires clearances at the head, sill and jambs to allow for thermal expansion and contraction as well as construction tolerances. 
Joints smaller than 1/4” may be subject to failure. 
All framing members, entrances and other materials are to be installed plumb, level and true with regard to established bench marks, column center lines or other working points established by the general contractor and checked by the erector, installer and/or glazing contractor.
Over tightening any fastener may cause stripping or fastener failure. 
Tubelite recommends the use of drill motors with clutches engaged to provide satisfactory tightening of the screw while preventing over torque. 
The use of impact drill motors is not recommended due to the absence of a clutch device.

If the building is designed without cable bracing, the erector is responsible for providing temporary erection bracing.
Only a final check of the building plumb remains, and few adjustments, if any, will be necessary.
Diagonal bracing in metal buildings is critical.
As on the walls, the general sequence is to install the roof sheets in conjunction with the insulation.
Good alignment of the screws, especially on the wall panels, will give a professional appearance to the wall panel installation.

Depending upon the increase in the quality of the cleaned surface, the blast cleaning is categorised into Grade - Sa2, Grade - Sa2 1/2 and Grade Sa- 3.
As the pool cools, molten metal at the fusion boundary solidifies, forming a solid bond with the parent metal.
Here again, since the welding is carried out in controlled conditions, better quality welds are obtained.
The surrounding cold parent metal resists this contraction so that the weld is subjected to a tensile stress.
Hence, the fabricator should adopt good fabrication practices that reduce the detrimental effect of residual stresses.
A double V or double U butt weld preparation reduces this distortion.
In single and double fillets, shrinkage across the throat area can lead to distortion as shown in Fig.4.
The distortion caused by a double fillet weld is important in box or plate girder webs where stiffeners are attached to only one side of the web.
Weld distortion of a flat plate with a series of stiffeners on one side can be countered by elastically prebending the plates.
When the plate cools the heated edge will shorten and so reduce the camber.
If the heat applied and the web panel thickness are such that there is a large temperature difference between the surfaces of the plate at each spot heat, then the resultant contraction on the hotter surface will produce a greater correction of the dish.
Triangles heated evenly through plate thickness
or fillet welds every 100 mm length is permitted.
During the last two decades, fabrication activities have increased steadily in yards adjacent to work.
Punching holes is a cold-working operation and can, therefore, cause brittle fracture.
Even in statically loaded structures the maximum thickness of plates in which holes can be punched is restricted.
During this operation, the overall dimensions of the structure including alignment, squareness, camber etc.
Hence welded joints need thorough inspection during and after the fabrication.
Depending upon the severity of service loading, the QAP may call for the level of NDT to be used.
Lifting and placing the member and temporarily holding in place.
Temporarily bracing the system to ensure stability during erection.
Aligning and permanently connecting the members by bolting or welding.
However, regardless of the method adopted the main aim during erection is the safety and preservation of the stability of the structure at all times.
For the guidance on general fabrication and erection of structural steel work, Chapter 11 of IS:800 (1984) must be followed.

CONSTRUCTION METHOD FOR PRECAST 
SYSTEM 
The main factor that contributes to the success of a precast building project is 'integration' of all building professionals.
Professionals stated here include architects, engineers, clients, contractors and sub-contractors.
Conventionally, consultants are more concerned with meeting clients' needs, regulatory requirements, design soundness and functionality while clients are more concerned with cost and the end product.
Contractors, on the other hand, are more concerned with the building process.
Very often, contractors are tasked to convert a traditional cast in-situ (Architectural and Structural) design to a precast design.
The design development will involve modification to the consultants' design intent.
As such, it is not uncommon for the contractor to face strong resistance from the consultant team.
This is to be predicted as any player tends to be defensive if his 'professional' views are being challenged.
Today, the fragmentation approach towards design and construction among the professionals within a project is evident in most projects.
A shift in paradigm is crucial to achieve success in any project.
This section attempts to provide a guide for the construction of a precast project.
The reader should refine the contents by consultation with professionals and precasters.
4.1 CONSTRUCTION CONSIDERATIONS 
The contractor should consider the following: 
- The lifting capacity of the crane used 
- The working boom-radius of the crane 
- The suitability of construction materials for the purpose of use, i.e.
sealant, grouting, shim plate, propping etc

It's not always necessary to use shims on the top doorjambâ€"the casing will hold it in place.
And on new homes and additions, walls can compress as they settle and push down on the top shims, causing the jamb to bow down.
Level the floor
The most critical step of any door installation is making sure the bottom of each doorjamb is at the proper height.

Video: How to Hang a Door
Travis Larson, an editor for The Family Handyman, shows you how to remove a door and hang a new one or rehang the old one.
Step 1: Overview
Hanging a door correctly is one of the most satisfying jobs in the home improvement world, but it's often the most challenging.
Unless it's installed correctly, your door can have uneven gaps along the jamb, or it can bind or not even latch.
In this article, we'll show you foolproof tips and techniques that'll give you great results every time.
All you need are simple carpentry tools and some basic home improvement skills and tools to easily master the techniques.
Also get a straight 7-ft.
Since installing trim is part of the door installation, purchase some matching door trim and be sure you've got a miter saw to cut it.
Pro Tips for Hanging Doors
An accurate level is crucial for a good installation.
They may be longer than you need.
Leaves a space of anywhere from 3/8 in.
to 5/8 in.
Back to Top 1
In this article, we'll focus on installing standard prehung doors.
These have a door jamb that's 4-9/16 in. wide and are made to fit into a 2x4 wall that's 4-1/2 in. thick.
This gives just enough of a fudge factor to have the jamb a bit proud of the wall surface on each side and to make up for any irregularities in the trimmer studs of the walls.
Most openings will be about 82 in. high for standard doors, so that's what we'll focus on.
If your wall is thicker or your opening is shorter, you'll have other concerns we won't cover here.
It should be 2 to 2-1/2 in.
wider than the door.
This extra space gives you room to fit the jambs and the shims into the opening to hang the door.
If your rough opening is 32 in., get a 30-in. prehung door.
Openings that have a trimmer stud out of plumb more than 3/8 in. from top to bottom will make it nearly impossible to install the door.
It would be somewhat like trying to put a rectangle into a parallelogram.
Small variations from plumb are quite common, however.
Most installation problems occur because the floor isn't level under the doorway.
How Do You Fit the Jamb to Floors of Different Heights?

The casing will cover up the nail holes when the blocks are removed.
This is where things get serious.
Nobody pays much attention to doors that work the way they should.
They open they close.
But doors that were improperly installed can bind, swing open by themselves or rattle in the breeze when they're closed.
How to Install an Interior Door
Community Q&A
Whether you're starting a room from scratch or just want to replace an old or distressed door, installing a door is easy and fast.
This project requires only a few tools, and most can be rented if you don't already own them.
These instructions are for a prehung door, or a door that's already attached to a frame with hinges.
Steps
Image titled Install an Interior Door Step 1
Doors and door openings are generally standard sizes, generally 24-36".
The framed-in rough opening for the door is always around 2" wider than the purchased door (not including the jamb around the door).
This allows for adjustment when installing the door to achieve plumb "level".

Step-by-Step 
Double-hung replacement windows
In this article, we'll show you step by step how to remove the old sash from double-hung windows and mount either a new sash kit or a wood or vinyl replacement insert inside your existing window jamb.
Even a beginner can do it.
They both fit in the space between the outside stop, called the blind stop, and the removable interior stop (see Fig.
A).
The sash replacement kit is designed to replace the sash in double-hung windows only.
Wood or vinyl replacement inserts, on the other hand, are self-contained units with their own jamb and sash, and can therefore be slid into almost any type of window jamb.
They are available as double-hung, sliding or casement-style windows.
Either type of replacement window must be installed in a solid, rot-free jamb.
Normal exposure to rain and snow often causes the exposed parts of poorly maintained windowsills or the lower sections of the exterior trim to rot.
An experienced carpenter can usually repair these areas with sections of new wood or you can use an epoxy repair system.
There's nothing worse than discovering that your nonreturnable, custom-sized window doesn't fit.
A).
A).
This step isn't necessary for ordering wood or vinyl replacement inserts.
Newer double-hungs may have springs or jamb liners instead, but once these are removed, the installation process is the same.

How to measure for replacement windows
It's easy to measure the rough opening width and height once you remove the wood trim.
But many DIYers make the mistake of not getting a precise depth measurement.
That turns a relatively easy job into an allday affair.
Your objective is to buy a window that fits within that opening.
If you don't, you'll have to make the opening smaller, or worse, enlarge the opening to fit the new window.
And that also means reworking all the exterior trim, siding and interior wall surfaces.
How to measure for replacement windows
Back to Top 1
Step 2: Replacement inserts or sash replacement kits?
Replacement window insert
Option 1: Wood or vinyl replacement inserts
For a maintenance-free window that doesn't require any painting or staining, consider vinyl replacement windows.
Some companies even make a simulated wood grain interior.
Since wood or vinyl replacement inserts have their own jamb, they can be installed in window jambs that are slightly out of square.
Shopping for replacement windows is a little trickier than buying sash kits because the quality of the windows varies dramatically and many are available only to contractors.
Some windows, like ours, have narrow vinyl sash parts that allow more light and a better view than windows with wide sash frames.
Option 2: Double-hung sash replacement kits
If you want to retain the authentic wood look of your old double-hung windows, sash replacement kits are the best option.
You can order the sashes with grilles to match the rest of the windows in your house and paint or stain the wood.
(You can choose grilles that either snap in or are glued to the glass.) But your old window jamb must be square and rot-free.
Double-hung sash replacement kits consist of two new wood window sashes, two vinyl jamb liners and installation hardware.
Features like energy-efficient low-E glass, simulated divided lites and maintenance-free exterior cladding are available for an extra cost.
Back to Top 1
Step 3: Installing wood or vinyl replacement inserts
The parting stop is usually caked with paint and difficult to remove.
The goal is to remove all hardware back to the blind stops (Photo 2).
You don't have to worry about dinging up the jamb and sill because they'll be covered.
Your wood or vinyl replacement insert will be slightly smaller than the window jamb opening to allow for shimming.
The key to a window that operates smoothly and seals properly is getting the frame perfectly square and the sides straight.
Photos 4 - 6 show how.
We won't talk about them in detail here.
CAUTION!
Houses built before 1978 may contain lead paint.

Step 4: Installing double-hung sash kits
The toughest part of sash replacement is tearing out the old window.
We chose screws because driving nails can be difficult in old window jambs.

Step 1
The jam extension is just a piece of wood that's been ripped down and attached to the window jamb to bring it even with the wall.
Step 2
Many windows will be multiple window sashes with moving tracks on the side.
Those types of windows may be easier to remove one sash at a time.
Step 3
It's not uncommon for an old window to leak, rotting out the jamb.
If there is damage, you will have to replace or repair the damaged areas of the jamb before moving forward.
Also, you will need to measure your rough opening to make sure that it can accommodate your new window.
The rough opening should be 1/4" to 3/8" larger than the exterior dimensions of the new window.
Step 4
The window stop is a piece of wood ripped down and placed around the exterior side of the window jamb.
The function of the stop is to prevent the window from sliding out of the opening.
It literally stops the window from moving.
It's very likely that the original stop is still in useable condition, but if it is damaged, you may need to repair or replace this as well.
Step 5
Step 6
Adding silicone to window edge.
Man installs new window in this framed area of this home improvement project.
The actual install of the window is very simple.
The window will usually come with its own hardware packet, typically consisting of four screws that will go through the sides of the unit to anchor it to the jamb.
Two screws should be put into each side of the window, one near the top and the other near the bottom (Image 4).
There will be pre-drilled holes in the window frame for the screws.
Step 7
There may be gaps around the original window frame the wall studs, and this is the perfect opportunity to insulate those areas better.
For harder to reach spots, you can use expanding spray insulation foam.
Step 8
You may also need to add thin strips of wood trim (a jamb extension, see Step 1) inside the original window frame to cover the gap between the new window and the drywall.
Pro Tip
Any slight gaps in the corners can be filled in with silicone before painting.
Step 9
The final step is to finish off the window framing by filling any nail holes with stainable/paintable wood putty and painting or staining the trim moulding around the window for a finished look.
New, vinyl replacement windows are low-maintenance, offer energy-efficient features and operate smoothly for years.

UNLOADING AND PREPARATION
OF PARTS FOR ASSEMBLY
The vehicle transporting your building parts must gain access to the building site from the adjacent highway or road.
Such access should be studied and prepared in advance of arrival.
A forklift or other type of power loader may be required to unload the truck and move the heavier parts to the proper locations.
Unloading and placing the steel parts of the building in the most convenient places for assembly will make the process easier and faster.
Note: Prolonged exposure to the weather before assembly or stacking the steel in a haphazard way can cause the painted parts to become damaged, or the
building parts to warp.
After unloading the truck and before the driver leaves, ensure that all parts have been delivered.
Each part is marked for identification.
www.muellerinc.com
B-1
UNLOADING, HANDLING, AND
STORAGE OF MATERIALS
Structure
A great amount of time and trouble can be saved if the building parts are unloaded at the building site according to a pre-arranged plan.
Proper location and handling of components will eliminate unnecessary handling.
It also facilitates the placing of slings or cables around the members for later lifting and allows members to be bolted together into sub-assemblies while on the ground.
Extra care should always be exercised in the unloading operation to prevent injuries from handling the steel and to prevent damage to materials and the concrete slab.
If water is allowed to remain for extended periods in bundles of primed parts such as girts, purlins, etc., the pigment will fade and the paint will gradually soften reducing its bond to the steel.
Therefore, upon receipt of a job, all bundles of primed parts should be stored at an angle to allow any trapped water to drain away and permit air circulation for drying.
Puddles of water should not be allowed to collect and remain on columns or rafters for the same reason.
Note: Piece marks are stenciled on primary structural members.
B-2
877-2-MUELLER
LOCATION OF BUILDING PARTS
Purlins and girts, depending on the number of bundles, are usually stored near the sidewalls clear of other packages or parts.
Sheet packages are usually located along one or both sidewalls off the ground and sloping to one end to encourage drainage in case of rain.
Accessories are usually unloaded on a corner of the slab or off the slab near one end of the building to keep them as much out of the way as possible from the active area during steel erection.
Note: When filing claims either with the carrier or Mueller, Inc., the claim should indicate the item(s) in question:
- The bundle or container in question (if any)
- The actual quantity received.
- The quantity which should have been received or that which was damaged.
This is important for quickly retrieving the necessary information.
Also, the other information such as numbers, names and addresses should be indicated on claims as well as invoice numbers.
These procedures are primarily for your protection, A shortage discovered later can be caused by theft, misplacement or other causes and neither the carrier or Mueller can accept responsibility.

CARE AND HANDLING OF MUELLER SHEET METAL
Delivery
Mueller takes every precaution to ensure that material is delivered to the customer damage free and fully protected from the elements during shipment.
The following guidelines are recommended:
Handling: Proper care is required in unloading and handling panel bundles in order to prevent damage.
B-4
Sheets over 25' long require two forklifts.
For sheets over 10' long, two or more people may be required to carry the sheet.
877-2-MUELLER
WALL AND ROOF PANELS
Mueller's wall and roof panels including color coated, galvalume, and galvanized provide excellent service under widely varied conditions.
All unloading and erection personnel should fully understand that these panels are quality merchandise which merit cautious care in handling.
Under no circumstances should panels be handled roughly.
This avoids ground moisture and deters people from walking on the packages.
One end of the package should always be elevated to encourage drainage in case of rain.
All stacked metal panels are subject, to some degree, to localized discoloration or stain when water is trapped between their closely nested surfaces.
Mueller, Inc.
However, due to climatic conditions, water formed by condensation of humid air can become trapped between stacked sheets.
Water can also be trapped between the stacked sheets when exposed to rain.
This discoloration caused by trapped moisture is often called wet storage stain.
The stain is usually superficial and has little effect on the appearance or service life of the panels as long as it is not permitted to remain on the panels.
Therefore, it is imperative that all panels be inspected for moisture upon receipt of the order.
If moisture is present, dry the panels at once and store in a dry, warm place.
Panels can be slippery due to paint finish, wax, oil or atmospheric conditions.

Erection of Primary And Secondary Structural
C
GENERAL INFORMATION
Many methods and procedures are in use for erecting the structural portion of metal buildings.
The techniques of raising frames vary from erecting small clear spans and endwall frames in units to erecting the larger clear spans and modular frames in sections.
The erection methods used depend strictly on the type of building, the available equipment, the experience level of the crews, and the individual job conditions.
The variations in these factors preclude the establishment of a firm or specific set of erection rules and procedures.
Consequently, the erection operation must be tailored by the erector to fit individual conditions and requirements.
However, there are certain erection practices, pertaining to structural members, which are in general use and have proven sound over the years.
Descriptions of these follow.
Erectors are cautioned not to cut primary members (rigid frame columns, rafters, end bearing frame rafters, interior columns).
These are the primary support members for the frame and are designed as such.
Any cutting of these members may affect the structural stability.
A representative of Mueller's must be consulted prior to attempting alterations of these members.
Note: Do not install any material if its quality is in question.
Mueller, Inc.
will not be responsible for costs incurred associated with the installation and/or removal of same.
Warning!
In no case should building erection be started on green concrete.
Anchor bolts may pull loose, concrete spall (chip out along edges) may occur and equipment may crush or crack slab.

TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT REQUIRED
The types of tools and equipment required in order to assemble and erect the building depend on the size of the building purchased.
This part of the instruction manual lists the tools and equipment that are normally required for most buildings.
You may wish to use more or less power equipment or different tools than are listed as the need dictates.
Whatever tools are used, it is important to remember that using the recommended tools will enable the least effort and best manner of erecting the building.
If a contractor is going to erect the building for you, you will not have to concern yourself with the tool list as most contractors have the necessary tools and equipment that are required.
However, reference to the following list may be of value to the contractor if he has never assembled and erected a Mueller Prefabricated Steel Building.

RAISING RIGID FRAMES
The intermediate or interior frames nearest the bearing endwall are usually erected first.
This bay usually contains the diagonal bracing.
The proper completion and plumbing of this first bay is extremely important to the successful completion of the building.
Braced bay
Stand columns first
Temporary bracing
Although several methods are used to erect rigid frames, it has been found most satisfactory to erect the columns first, tie them together with the girts and tighten the anchor bolts*.
On small spans and short eave heights, columns can often be set in place by hand without the use of hoisting equipment.
Temporary bracing should always be installed as soon as sections are lifted in place.
*The anchor bolt tension may need to be adjusted to seat the rafter.
C-4
877-2-MUELLER
RAISING RIGID FRAMES (CONTINUED)
The size of the rafter that can be safely handled depends on the equipment available and the experience of the erection foreman.
Generally as many connections as possible are made on the ground.
Note: Drawing above is intended as a general rigging method.
Actual rigging method will vary with member configuration.
www.muellerinc.com
C-5
RAISING RIGID FRAMES (CONTINUED)
Lifting Cables And Spreader Bars
In all instances the length of the lifting cables should be such that the angle between the rafter and the lifting cables is no less than 45 degrees.
Spreader bar 45 degree minimum
Rafters
Note: Drawing above is intended as a general rigging method.
Actual rigging method will vary with member configuration.
Hands and feet should be kept clear of moving loads and never stand under a load being lifted.
C-6
877-2-MUELLER
RAISING RIGID FRAMES (CONTINUED)
Completing And Plumbing The First Bay
After the first intermediate or interior frames have been set, Mueller, Inc.
recommends that all purlins, girts, and eave struts be installed in the braced bay and the entire bay plumbed, aligned and braced before proceeding further.
When this bay is properly and accurately plumbed and braced, the remaining members, to a large degree, will automatically plumb and align when installed.
Interior Bay
Note: Purlin Nesting note goes here.
Something about underclip

C-7
RAISING RIGID FRAMES (CONTINUED)
In most instances the work proceeds from outside columns inward toward the peak until the entire frame is bolted into place.
The same general procedures of erection apply to either clear span or multiple span frames.
In the case of the latter, the support for rafter sections during erection is generally supplied by the interior columns themselves, making temporary supports unnecessary.
Two words of caution concerning the erection of rigid frames are in order.
The first is that rigid frames, especially free ends or cantilevered sections should never be left "for the day" in an unsupported, unbraced or unguyed condition.
Such practice has resulted in the total loss of considerable amounts of erected steel because of wind.
The second word of caution pertains to the additional care required in the erection of multiple span frames compared to clear span frames.
Frames with interior columns, because of closer supports, have much lighter sections.
They are much more apt to buckle during erection than clear span frames, and consequently require greater care in rigging and handling.
Connection Bolts
Bolts used to make connections in secondary framing members such as the purlins are usually 1/2" diameter, ASTM designation A307.
All primary framing or main framing connections are made with ASTM A325 bolts, usually 5/8", 3/4", 7/8" and 1" diameters.
The size and grade of the bolt are marked on the building erection drawings.
Main Frame: An assemblage of rafters and columns that support the secondary framing members and transfer loads directly to the foundation.
Secondary Framing: Members that carry loads from the building surface to the main framing.
For example - purlins and girts.
C-8
877-2-MUELLER
ERECTING COLUMN AND BEAM ENDWALLS
Column and beam endwalls of 50 feet or less in span may be raised into position and set on the anchor bolts as a unit.
All rafters, column, girts (except outside endwall girts which connect to the sidewall girts), door headers, door jambs, clips, diagonal brace rods, etc.
A spreader bar should be used to raise the endwall frame.
Because of the flexibility of the column and beam frames, care must be taken in locating the points of attachment of the cables, and in raising the frame, to avoid bending about the minor axis.
For spans of 60 feet and greater, the columns are usually erected first and then capped with the endwall rafter.
The girts, headers, jambs and diagonal brace rods are then added between the end columns.
Final bolt tightening should be done once the frame is plumb and square.
Spreader bar
Note: Drawing above is intended as a general rigging method.
Actual rigging method will vary with member configuration.
www.muellerinc.com
C-9
ERECTING THE REMAINING FRAMES & Eave struts
The remaining frames are erected in like manner, initially with only a few purlins being installed in each bay working from one end of the building to the other.
All purlin, girt and eave strut connection bolts are left loose so the entire skeleton framework can be plumbed without undue difficulty.
The remaining purlins can be positioned on the rafter in each bay to facilitate the completion of the roof framing.
Temporary bracing may be required to stabilize the structure during erection.
C-10
877-2-MUELLER
JOINTS NOT SUBJECT TO TENSION LOADS
Joints not subject to tension loads need only be tightened to the snug tight condition, defined as the tightness attained by a few impacts of an impact wrench or the full effort of a man using an ordinary spud wrench.
Joints Subject To Tension Loads
Two tightening procedures are specified for A325 bolts in joints subject to tension loads, turn-ofthe-nut method and direct tension indicator.
Tightening by use of a direct tension indicator - Tightening by this means is permitted provided it can be demonstrated, by an accurate direct measurement procedure, that the bolts have been tightened to specified tension.

They provide support for wind loads or other longitudinal loads, such as those created by an overhead crane in the completed structure.
Many times additional temporary bracing is needed to stabilize the structure during erection.

ALIGNING THE GIRTS
Installation of the building walls is generally done before the roof.
One method of aligning the girts is to cut temporary wood blocking to the proper length and install between the lines of girts.
This blocking can be moved from bay to bay, which will reduce the number of pieces required.
Normally, one line of blocking per bay will be sufficient.
Banding can also be used to hold the girts straight and plumb.

Blocking
Typical construction of the wood blocking is show below.
A 2" x 4" minimum board size should be used.

877-2-MUELLER
SCREW ALIGNMENT
One way this can be accomplished is by pre-drilling holes in the panels at identical locations.
Up to 15 panels can be stacked together and drilled using a template panel.
It is important to clean metal shavings off panel surfaces after drilling to avoid rust stains.

INSTALLATION OF FINAL PANEL
While backlapping the last roof panel (to match panel coverage with the building length) is routinely done, this installation method can compromise the integrity of the roof by trapping moisture between the panels.
This moisture could, in time, create an environment conducive to rust and metal failure.
Manufacturer recommends field cutting the final panel lengthwise to create the desired panel width necessary to finish off the building.
The cut edge of the panel should always be installed on the outside edge, not the lap edge.
The "narrow" panel should be handled with care, and foot traffic avoided until the final panel is completely installed.

SAFETY PRECAUTIONS FOR ROOFING WORK
Manufacturer strongly recommends that erection employees be continuously trained in safe and productive work practices.
Hard hats should be worn on job sites to prevent injury from falling objects.
Safe work practices on all erection duties should be carefully reviewed with erection crews prior to beginning each job.
Warning!
Panels May Collapse If Not Properly Secured.
Roof panels must be completely attached to the purlins and to panels on either side before they can be a safe walking surface.
Skylights or translucent panels can never be considered as a walking surface.
Partially attached or unattached panels should never be walked on!
DO NOT:
A single roof panel must never be used as a work platform.
