Move and stack boxes with proper support to prevent distortion.
If rain exposure, condensation or any water contact is likely, then all packaging material should be removed.
All materials should be checked for quantity and quality upon receipt.
Aluflam must be contacted immediately of any discrepancies in shipment.
Check to make sure that you have the required supplies and tools necessary for the installation.
Carefully check the openings and surrounding construction that will receive your material.
Remember, if the construction is not per the construction documents, it is your responsibility to notify the general contractor in writing.
Any discrepancies must be brought to the general contractor’s attention before you proceed with the installation.
Collect your shop drawings, materials, packing list, and this installation manual.
Carefully review parts location, the sequence of installation, when you glaze it, and how you seal it.
Consult Aluflam prior to substituting any material to ensure that the products’ fire ratings are not violated.
Remember to isolate, in an approved manner, all aluminum from uncured masonry or other incompatible materials.
If any questions arise concerning Aluflam products or their installation, contact Aluflam for clarification before proceeding.
Take the extra time to wrap and protect the installed material.
Concrete, mortar, plaster, muriatic acid and other alkaline and acid based construction and cleaning materials may be very harmful to framefinishes and should be removed with water and mild soap immediately or permanent damage or staining of the finishes may occur.
All work must start from, and be referenced to benchmarks, offset lines and/or column centerlines established by the architectural drawings and the general contractor.
All frames must be installed plumb, square, level and true, and in accordance with approved shop drawings.
DETERMINE FRAME REFERENCE POINT
Establish the frame reference lines or the exterior/interior plane of the frames to be installed using either bench marks, offset lines, or column centerlines provided by the general contractor and referenced on the shop drawings.
Use the established reference points to determine the installation points for each frame opening at the head, and jambs.
UNPACK FRAME
Remove loose components, such as pressure plates, glass clips, intumescent strips, gaskets, covers, fasteners, etc, and set aside in a well protected area.
Carefully lift frame out of packaging.
Handle the frame with extreme care to avoid separation of corner joints.
In the case of attached, multiple frame sections – assemble the frame sections into larger units prior to installing into the wall opening(see example).
Lay out all frames to be attached on a smooth, dry surface.
Ensure that frames are well protected from abrasion and impact.
Slide horizontal members onto “T” brackets and secure joints through factory pre-drilled holes. 
For exterior applications, follow instructions below:

Make sure intumescent band does not cover the stainless steel setting blocks.
If needed, cut the band.
Place insulating spacers on top of setting blocks.
Make sure that proper tools and lifting capacity is available prior to opening glass crate.
Avoid impact with any metal objects and avoid setting the glass down directly onto floor.

Center the glass in the frame opening and carefully set the unit down onto the setting blocks.
While supporting glass in place, secure it by fastening stainless steel glass clips at pre-drilled locations. 
Attach pressure plates at pre-drilled locations.
Snap on covers.
For exterior applications, follow instructions below:
Apply CRL Clear 33S Silicone Sealant or equivalent into pre-drilled holes for glass clips. 
Fill gaps around frame with mineral wool insulating material.
Pack as tightly as possible.
Finish gaps by applying a continuous bead of silicone caulking. Use 3M Fire Barrier Sealant CP 25WB or equivalent.
Clean glass units using mild glass cleaner.
For further information, refer to Vetrotech’s glass cleaning and maintenance instructions.
Because each project will have differing conditions, each project should have job specific drawings prepared by journeymen drafters or engineers who are familiar with curtain-wall construction and have an intimate understanding of PRL’s curtain wall system and how to integrate it into the construction details specific to the project it is being used on.
When in doubt contact your PRL technical representative.
Engineering calculations and shop drawing review should be performed by a professional engineer.
Coordinate with your sealant supplier to be sure you are using the correct sealants.
Coordinate with the sealant supplier to be sure of compatibility and adhesion with all curtain wall and building components.
Have your sealant supplier test for compatibility and adhesion with all curtain wall and building components on each project you perform and give you a written report stating that all materials conform.
In each case you must fully clean the surface that the caulking is to adhere to.
It is not always necessary to follow these instructions in the exact order we have suggested but you should be familiar enough with the construction of PRL’s curtain wall should you decide to deviate and specify an alternate order of fabrication and assembly.
When in doubt contact your PRL technical representative.
Isolate and separate aluminum products from steel, masonry and cementitious materials.
Check all shipments from PRL immediately upon receipt thereof.
Check for damage, count and quality.
Inform your PRL service representative immediately of errors, omissions, questionable quality or damage.
